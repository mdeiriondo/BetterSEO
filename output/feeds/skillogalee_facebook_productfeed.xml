        <title>Estate Cabernet 2021</title>
        <description>Hand-crafted in small quantities, our Estate Cabernet is an aromatic and succulent blend, composed predominantly of Cabernet Sauvignon with some vintages containing small selections of Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Our low-yielding, dry-grown vines are more than 50 years-old and situated on the high natural contours of our single estate property in the Clare Valley. Hand pruning, hand harvesting and sustainable farming techniques ensure the purest expression of fruit and terroir are achieved from these old vines.
Tasting Notes
The wine has a deep, intense, and opaque ruby red colour, with an aroma that is characterised by notes of ripe black fruit (blackberry, cassis), mint, and with hints of green bell pepper, tobacco, cedar, and vanilla. This Cabernet Sauvignon shows lifted violets and bright flavours of blackcurrant spice and chocolate with an elegant fine tannin backbone.
Ready to drink but with careful cellaring this wine has the potential to mature gracefully for ten+ years.
Winemaking
After cold soaking, and fermentation in small batch open tanks, the skins are gently basket-pressed and the wine is aged for up to two years in predominantly French oak hogsheads. After blending, the resulting wine not only delights the senses with its aroma and flavour, but also embodies the unique land and season in which it was produced.
Vintage
With cool and dry weather, the 2021 vintage in the Clare Valley produced lovely fruit with excellent varietal character and natural acidity. The cool growing season was preceded by late-winter and early-spring rains which allowed for good spring growth on the vines. This was followed by below average rainfall and dry conditions for the remainder of the season, resulting in a vintage that produced beautiful and classic Clare wines with smaller bunches and grapes therefore reducing yield.

        <title>Estate Chardonnay 2022</title>
        <description>Tucked away within the Riesling vineyards surrounding the historic Skillogalee House sits a small parcel of Chardonnay that was planted more than 40 years ago. Skillogalee Chardonnay is only produced in limited quantities, and only in those vintages with suitable growing conditions.
Tasting Notes
The Chardonnay grapes were the first to be picked for Skillogalee&amp;rsquo;s 2022 harvest at the end of February &amp;ndash; picking earlier helped retain high natural acidity. The palate is fresh and flinty with flavours of apple, pear and hints of white peach and a subtle creaminess adding to the complexity.
A wine that pairs beautifully with seafood dishes, creamy pastas, vegetable dishes, and light meats such as chicken and pork.
Winemaking
These vines are sustainably grown and individually hand-harvested when the optimum flavour and ripeness is reached. The grapes are chilled and gently pressed before the juice is moved to a blend of new and old French oak barrels for primary and malolactic fermentation, which further integrates the fruit characters and acidity. During the maturation in barrel the wine undergoes b&amp;acirc;tonnage, where the lees are regularly stirred to introduce textural creaminess and depth to the palate.
Vintage
The 2022 vintage was one of outstanding quality, with delicate concentration of flavour and structure &amp;ndash; producing truly great wines. Ample winter and spring rainfall ensured adequate soil moisture for our dry-grown vines, the cool, dry weather through summer and early autumn provided ideal ripening conditions to produce fruit with high natural acidity and beautiful varietal flavour. The slow start and belated budburst, in combination with the cooler summer, resulted in one of the latest starts to harvest in more than a decade.

The wine is pale straw hue with green tinges. Exotic aromatics of orange blossom and zest with ginger and white pepper spice follow through onto the palate which is slippery and textured all balanced by refreshing, juicy acidity and a lingering, dry finish.

        <title>Estate Gewurztraminer 2023</title>
        <description>We handcraft our Gewurztraminer in a classic style &amp;ndash; textural, aromatic, and spicy with a crisp finish. The grapes are sourced from hand-managed vines located on the contours of the Skillogalee estate, both from in front of our historic cellar door and from the slopes adjoining the Spring Gully conservation park. Our vines are grown using minimal intervention and sustainable farming practices to minimise the impact on our environment.
Tasting Notes
This wine presents a light straw colour with hints of green. It entices the senses with a bouquet of aromatic rose petals, Turkish Delight, and the sweet scent of passionfruit flowers. The taste is luscious and well-structured, offering a silky mouthfeel counterpoised by a vibrant, juicy acidity and a persistent, dry aftertaste.
An excellent companion to a diverse range of culinary delights, this wine particularly shines alongside subtly spiced, modern Asian dishes, vibrant summer salads, and richly seasoned white meat preparations.
Winemaking
Once the fruit has reached optimum ripeness, flavour, and acidity, each block is individually harvested by hand. Each parcel is fermented separately to allow our small winemaking team to use the techniques best suited to highlighting the unique and distinctive characteristics of the different grapes. The individual parcels are tasted and then blended to create a balanced and structured wine ready to be bottled.
Vintage
The 2023 vintage highlights the art of precision in vineyard care and keen weather attentiveness. A particularly wet winter-spring led to a slower onset of the growing season, culminating in well-timed flowering and a March harvest. This period nurtured our white varieties, particularly Riesling and Gew&amp;uuml;rztraminer, with minimal rainfall from Christmas to March contributing to their remarkable flavour development and ideal acidity. Despite early challenges, the resilience and care in cultivation shone through, presenting wines that truly embody the celebrated terroir of Clare Valley.

        <description>Vintage 2011 saw higher than average rainfall and lower temperatures throughout the season, necessitating selective picking at harvest time and some loss of what would otherwise have been a relatively heavy crop. The bunches that were selected showed excellent flavour and composition.
On the nose it has lively fresh lime, acacia and linden blossom aromatics. The palate has tight, stoney minerality with intense lemon drop, citrus flavours. A refreshing, crisp acidity provides the backbone for a dry, lingering finish. Drink now with fish, seafood or white meat dishes or cellar for up to 10 years.

The nose has an aromatic lift with lively kaffir lime and white blossom florals. The palate is focused, with typical citrus flavours like brown lime and grapefruit complimented by a lean, tight minerality. The crisp, clean natural acidity provides the backbone for a dry, lingering finish.

        <title>Estate Riesling 2013</title>
        <description>Riesling was again one of the highlights of the 2013 Clare Valley vintage. The Skillogalee Riesling harvest commenced earlier than usual, but most unusual was the fact that most of the Shiraz had been picked prior to commencing Riesling processing. Some warm and then cool spells allowed for excellent flavour ripening with good natural acidity. A dry growing season with low disease pressure helped to maintain pristine fruit.
The nose has an intense aromatic lift of musk, ginger spice and fresh Tahitian lime juice. The palate is focused, with a lovely backbone of natural acidity that supports a natural fruit sweetness with flavours of mango, red grapefruit and cumquats coming through. The wine demonstrates fantastic line and length and has a zesty dry finish.
Drink now with fish, seafood or white meat dishes or cellar for up to 10 years.

        <title>Estate Riesling 2014</title>
        <description>Riesling was again one of the highlights of the 2014 Clare Valley vintage. The mild, dry spring was followed by a long, dry, and very hot summer until mid-February when the valley received some respite with more than 100mm of rain. This break in the weather was followed by mild days and cool nights with large diurnals allowing for ideal ripening conditions. Yields were slightly below average, and some fruit loss was experience due to the heat, but overall another very good vintage following on from the excellent 2012 and 2013 vintages.
The wine is straw like in appearance with a green tint. The nose has a big lift of Bergamot orange, with white peach, freshly picked lemongrass, green papaya and a hint of juniper. The palate is finely structured with intense and pure citrus fruit comprising of tangelo, clementine and desert lime, with passionfruit highlights. The wine has impressive length and a natural acid backbone, and has a mouth-wateringly dry finish. Drink now with fish, seafood or white meat dishes or cellar for up to 10 years.

        <title>Estate Riesling 2015</title>
        <description>The 2015 Estate Riesling displays a straw-like appearance with a green tinge, accompanied by a vibrant nose of jasmine and lemon zest. On the palate, it is full-flavoured, exuding bright citrus spice and a succulent juiciness, with prominent notes of tangerine and Tahitian lime. The wine is enhanced by fresh, zesty acidity, contributing to its impressive length and robust natural acid backbone. It concludes with a mouth-wateringly dry finish, showcasing the refined character of this vintage.
Vintage
The 2015 Clare Valley vintage concluded impressively after an almost ideal growing season, marked by above-average winter rainfall and a largely trouble-free spring, despite some isolated frost damage. A mild early summer, followed by a hot February, prompted an early harvest, starting 2-3 weeks sooner than usual. The wines from this vintage exhibit excellent varietal definition with robust flavour, structure, and outstanding natural acidity, suggesting potential for longevity. Riesling quality was particularly high, delighting producers. Recognised as one of the best in the last decade, this vintage marks the fourth successful year following the challenging 2011 season in Clare Valley.

        <description>The 2016 Estate Riesling presents a straw hue with a subtle green tinge, revealing an alluring nose rich with scents of white flowers, lime blossom, and musk. On the palate, it is full-flavoured, showcasing a pronounced fruit weight alongside a crisp, herbal texture. The wine unfolds layers of Tahitian lime zest and pith, accented by delicate citrus spice and vibrant, juicy acidity that enhances its freshness and sharp acid profile. With its impressive length, dynamic natural acid backbone, and compelling, powerful finish, this Riesling demonstrates both sophistication and depth.
Vintage
The 2016 Clare Valley vintage enjoyed a favorable growing season with a mild, dry early spring promoting early bud burst and rapid vine growth. Winter 2015 was initially cold but milder conditions and late August rains allowed vines to store extra nutrients. Flowering completed by November, with good post-flowering rains and no spring frost. A dry period from November to January increased water demand, stressing some vineyards, but timely late January and early February rains alleviated stress and slowed ripening, enabling optimal harvest conditions. The quality of Shiraz and Riesling from this vintage is outstanding.

        <description>The 2017 Estate Riesling, while maturing, still exhibits youthful qualities with its bright straw hue and a green tinge. The aroma is enticingly perfumed with jasmine, orange blossom spice, and lemon zest. On the palate, the wine is full-flavoured, boasting excellent fruit concentration and a fine, herbal-edged texture. It features dominant flavours of lemon and lime zest and pith, enhanced by subtle citrus spice and succulent, juicy acidity. The wine impresses with its length, a vibrant natural acid backbone, and a mouth-wateringly powerful finish. Despite its age, it maintains a lighter, yet finely framed structure, indicating both elegance and longevity.
Vintage
The 2017 Clare Valley vintage was notably delayed, starting in late February, the latest since 2011, due to a cold, wet winter that pushed budburst up to a month behind schedule. Despite early challenges, including over 120mm of rain in September causing waterlogged soils and some frost damage, favourable conditions during flowering led to a successful fruit set. The year concluded as one of the wettest since 2000, with damp conditions lingering into the growing season. Harvest stretched into early May, with some late harvest styles not picked until mid-May. Overall, the 2017 vintage was above average, with Riesling excelling as the standout white varietal and Cabernets along with other late-ripening reds also performing well. The resultant wines, like our 2017 Estate Riesling, display remarkable depth and vibrancy, reflecting both the challenges and triumphs of the season.

        <title>Estate Riesling 2018</title>
        <description>The 2018 Estate Riesling showcases a bright straw colour with a green tinge, complemented by a perfumed nose of jasmine, orange blossom spice, and lemon zest. The palate is full-flavoured, boasting excellent fruit concentration and a rich texture that enhances the vibrant flavours of lemon and lime zest and pith. Delicate hints of citrus spice and succulent, juicy acidity add a layer of freshness, balancing the wine's inherent fruit sweetness which is showing exceptionally well. Structurally, the wine impresses with its significant length, lively natural acid backbone, and a mouth-wateringly powerful finish, making it a standout vintage.
Vintage
The 2018 Clare Valley vintage commenced in early February, earlier than usual, due to a dry growing season. Although the region avoided significant spring frost, it faced well-below-average rainfall, reducing soil moisture levels and leading to concerns about leaf loss and sunburn due to warm temperatures and occasional extreme heat. Despite minimal disease pressure, high water usage was a challenge for vineyards with limited resources, and yields were expected to be 10-15% lower than the previous year. Nevertheless, Riesling shone as the standout white variety, yielding good results and maintaining high quality amidst these conditions. The vintage, while challenging, ultimately produced wines of very good to excellent quality, highlighting the resilience of the varietals such as Riesling in dry conditions.

        <title>Estate Riesling 2022</title>
        <description>The 2022 Estate Riesling is vibrant and lively, presenting a crisp profile with elegant acidity highlighted by clean, zesty Tahitian lime. It is beautifully balanced with floral aromas and subtle mineral notes, leading to a succulent, mouthwatering finish. This wine showcases bright flavours and a natural acidity that, together with its graceful structure, perfectly captures the unique terroir of our ancient soils and dramatic topography.
Stunning in the glass, it is delightful to enjoy now and is also poised to benefit from careful cellaring.
Vintage
The 2022 vintage was one of outstanding quality, with delicate concentration of flavour and structure &amp;ndash; producing truly great wines. Ample winter and spring rainfall ensured adequate soil moisture for our dry-grown vines, the cool, dry weather through summer and early autumn provided ideal ripening conditions to produce fruit with high natural acidity and beautiful varietal flavour. The slow start and belated budburst, in combination with the cooler summer, resulted in one of the latest starts to harvest in more than a decade.

        <title>Estate Riesling 2023</title>
        <description>Our Estate Riesling is crafted from dry-grown vines situated on the sloping hills of our family-owned estate in the Sevenhill subregion of the Clare Valley. These low-yield vines are carefully tended to by hand, following sustainable farming practices for both the preservation of the land and the authenticity of the wine&amp;rsquo;s terroir.
Tasting Notes
Vibrant and invigorating, this striking wine is characterised by refined acidity, enlivened with a brisk splash of Tahitian lime, delicate floral scents, and harmonious mineral undertones, culminating in a tantalising succulence. Its vivid flavours, inherent acidity, and elegant composition are a true reflection of our age-old soils and the remarkable landscape of Skillogalee. Strikingly lively in appearance, this wine is perfect for immediate enjoyment or will enhance beautifully with careful ageing.
Winemaking
The grapes are harvested only when they have reached the perfect balance of ripeness, flavour, and acidity, and then hand-picked and treated as separate parcels during the winemaking process. Each parcel is fermented separately, allowing our small winemaking team to highlight its unique characteristics. Finally, the parcels are meticulously blended just prior to bottling to create a balanced and structured wine, ready to be enjoyed today or in the future.
Vintage
The 2023 vintage highlights the art of precision in vineyard care and keen weather attentiveness. A particularly wet winter-spring led to a slower onset of the growing season, culminating in well-timed flowering and a March harvest. This period nurtured our white varieties, particularly Riesling and Gew&amp;uuml;rztraminer, with minimal rainfall from Christmas to March contributing to their remarkable flavour development and ideal acidity. Despite early challenges, the resilience and care in cultivation shone through, presenting wines that truly embody the celebrated terroir of Clare Valley.

        <title>Estate Rosé 2021</title>
        <description>The blend composition is predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon with the remainder comprising Malbec. The wine shows a vibrant crimson with a purple tint. There are aromas of wild strawberries, blackcurrant, fresh cranberry and hints of rosewater. The palate is slick, fresh and lively with some natural acid backbone. There is a succulent balance of flavours that include cherry, Satsuma plum and raspberry.
This wine is best served chilled, especially during the warmer months and is a great match for many food styles, particularly duck and light meats, fresh seafood and contemporary Asian cuisine.
Vintage
With cool and dry weather, the 2021 vintage in the Clare Valley produced lovely fruit with excellent varietal character and natural acidity. The cool growing season was preceded by late-winter and early-spring rains which allowed for good spring growth on the vines. This was followed by below average rainfall and dry conditions for the remainder of the season, resulting in a vintage that produced beautiful and classic Clare wines with smaller bunches and grapes therefore reducing yield.

        <title>Estate Rosé 2023</title>
        <description>Our Estate Rose is meticulously crafted from dry-grown vines on our family-owned estate in the Clare Valley. Each vintage&amp;rsquo;s blend is thoughtfully composed, reflecting the year&amp;rsquo;s unique character and drawing from a selection of our low-yielding red grape varieties including Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Malbec. These grapes, thriving on the elevated slopes of our property, contribute to the distinctive profile and quality of our Ros&amp;eacute;.
Description
This meticulously handcrafted Ros&amp;eacute; is derived from Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, selectively harvested early from our own estate vineyards specifically for this wine. The blend is composed mainly of Shiraz (60%) and complemented by Cabernet Sauvignon (40%). Exhibiting a delicate pink hue, this wine boasts vibrant aromas of fresh red berries and subtle floral notes, leading to a juicy palate and concluding with a crisp, refreshing finish.
Winemaking
Hand-picked fruit is specially harvested for this wine, with the blend of varieties varying each vintage to craft a wine of intense fruit character and authentic varietal expression. Upon arrival at the winery, the fruit is blended, destemmed, and cooled before pressing. To extract the optimal level of colour and flavour, the juice is macerated with the skins in the press for several hours. The free-run juice and light pressings are subsequently cold-settled and racked, undergoing a cool fermentation process to preserve the delicate, floral fruit nuances inherent in the grape varieties.
Vintage
The 2023 vintage highlighted the art of precision in vineyard care and keen weather attentiveness. A particularly wet winter-spring led to a slower onset of the growing season, culminating in well-timed flowering and a later harvest. The prolonged ripening period, enhanced by a dry spell from Christmas to March, cultivated nuanced flavours and a refined style in the red varieties. Despite early challenges, the resilience and care in vineyard shone through, presenting wines that truly embody the celebrated terroir of Clare Valley.

        <title>Estate Shiraz 2013</title>
        <description>The 2013 Basket Pressed Shiraz offers a distinct earthiness, complemented by rich aromas of anise, spearmint, and dark chocolate. On the palate, this wine unfolds a complex array of flavours, featuring plum, coconut rough, and sweet, warm spices, all layered over a smoky undertone that persists with each sip. The texture is bold and fleshy, yet maintains a balanced medium body that gracefully supports the depth of flavours. This Shiraz is a robust yet refined showcase of varietal character.
Vintage
The 2013 vintage in Clare Valley was marked by some of the driest conditions on record, resulting in smaller, open canopies and a compact, early harvest that began in the first week of February. Despite the challenges of dry weather, which included frost and isolated hail events causing significant crop losses, a timely 50mm of rain in early December positively impacted yields. The dry conditions ensured virtually no disease pressure. Shiraz yields were lower than average, but the quality and flavour intensity of the harvested grapes were exceptional. Overall, the 2013 vintage is regarded as solid, with very strong quality in the Shiraz produced.

        <description>The 2014 Basket Pressed Shiraz exudes a pronounced earthiness, complemented by rich aromas of blue fruits, leather, and tobacco. On the palate, this wine unfolds a complex tapestry of flavours, including ripe plum, juicy blackberry, refreshing spearmint, and luxurious dark chocolate. These elements are seamlessly integrated atop a backdrop of smoky persistence. The texture is bold and fleshy, yet retains a well-balanced medium body that enhances its depth and complexity.
Vintage
The 2014 Clare Valley vintage kicked off after above-average winter rains and mild spring conditions, leading to a well-timed bud-burst in late September. A cool spell in mid-November extended the flowering of Shiraz, resulting in variable fruit set. The early part of 2014 brought periods of extreme heat, prompting early veraison and the beginning of the vintage in February. A significant rainfall in mid-February provided crucial relief to the water-stressed Shiraz vines, fostering ideal ripening conditions with minimal impact on wine quality. Overall, yields for Shiraz were generally average or slightly below, but the quality of the fruit was good to excellent, with minimal pest and disease issues. The 2014 vintage, although slightly below average in production, maintained the consistent quality associated with Clare Valley Shiraz.

        <title>Estate Shiraz 2015</title>
        <description>The 2015 Basket Pressed Shiraz displays a pronounced earthiness, with captivating aromas of blue fruits, leather, and tobacco that lead into a rich palate of plum, blackberry, spearmint, and dark chocolate. These flavours are beautifully layered over a smoky persistence, creating a complex sensory experience. The wine is bold and fleshy yet remains balanced with a medium body. It has been matured in a combination of French and American oak, which adds subtle depth and complements the robust character of the wine, poised for excellent ageing potential.
Vintage
The 2015 Clare Valley vintage for Shiraz ended on a high note, following an almost ideal growing season characterised by above-average winter rainfall and a trouble-free spring, despite some isolated frost damage. A mild early summer, followed by a hot February, prompted an early start to the harvest&amp;mdash;about 2-3 weeks ahead of the usual schedule. The Shiraz from this vintage is showing fantastic varietal definition, boasting great flavour, structure, and excellent natural acidity that suggests good potential for longevity. The compact nature of the vintage, especially in February, required prioritisation in harvesting, but the generally mild conditions helped maintain the quality of the fruit. Overall yields were at least average, with the Shiraz demonstrating resilience in productivity. This vintage is celebrated as one of the best for Shiraz in Clare Valley in the last decade.

        <title>Estate Shiraz 2016</title>
        <description>The 2016 Basket Pressed Shiraz exudes a pronounced earthiness, complemented by deep aromas of blue fruits, leather, and tobacco. On the palate, this wine unveils a rich array of flavours including ripe plum, juicy blackberry, refreshing spearmint, and luxurious dark chocolate, all harmoniously layered over a persistent smoky note. The texture is bold and fleshy, yet retains a well-balanced medium body. The Shiraz is fruit-driven and concentrated, boasting velvety tannins that lend structure without the need for fining. Its maturation in a mix of French and American oak hogsheads has significantly enhanced the wine&amp;rsquo;s character, balance, and complexity.
Vintage
The 2016 vintage in the Clare Valley presented a favourable growing season for Shiraz, starting with a cold winter that shifted to milder conditions with beneficial late rains in August, enabling the vines to absorb extra nutrients. A mild and dry early spring prompted early bud burst and rapid vine growth, accelerating the season's progress. Flowering was largely complete by November, supported by good post-flowering rains and no spring frost. A dry spell from November to January increased water demand, putting some stress on vineyards; however, timely rains in late January and early February alleviated this stress and moderated the ripening process, setting the stage for an optimal harvest. The 2016 Shiraz showcased outstanding quality, reflecting the well-managed challenges of the season.

        <title>Estate Shiraz 2018</title>
        <description>The 2018 Basket Press Shiraz showcases lifted dark berry fruit flavours, including plum skin and spice, characteristic of its concentrated richness from the 2018 vintage. The maturation in both French and American oak barrels has significantly enhanced the wine&amp;rsquo;s character, balance, and complexity, embodying the finest traditions of Clare Valley winemaking.
This Shiraz is poised for excellent ageing, with potential to cellar beautifully for at least 10 years. However, for those eager to enjoy it sooner, it pairs splendidly with red or game meats, spicy Indian cuisine, or rich pasta dishes, making it a versatile and enjoyable choice for a variety of dining experiences.
Vintage
The 2018 vintage can be summed up as a long dry growing season, which started with low moisture in the soil due to previous winter and spring both also both being dry with below average annual rainfall of only about 500mm. This was combined with above average temperatures throughout the season, rather than any specific heatwave. While this weather meant yields for 2018 were down on the previous vintage, the fruit produced this season was incredibly rich and concentrated producing wines of outstanding quality and character.

        <title>Estate Shiraz 2021</title>
        <description>Our Basket Press Shiraz is crafted from grapes carefully harvested from low-yielding, dry-grown vines planted on the slopes and contours of the Skillogalee estate in the wooded hills of the Clare Valley. Our cool climate vineyards were planted in the 1970s and many of the vines are now over 50 years old, yielding less fruit but producing a more flavourful and structurally complex wine.
Tasting Notes
The wine has a deep and intense ruby red colour, enriched by complex and layered nose with notes of dark fruit (blackberry, black cherry), spices (pepper, cloves), and a hint of earthiness. This Shiraz shows dark berry fruit flavours of plum skin and fennel seed spice with a plush and silky mid palate core and long finely structured tannin.
Stunning and vibrant drinking now, or will reward careful cellaring for ten+ years.
Winemaking
The grapes are hand-harvested at the peak of ripeness, sorted and vinified in open fermenters. The wine is then gently basket-pressed to preserve the delicate fruit character and velvety tannins before being barrel aged in oak for 12-18 months. The winemaking team carefully tastes and blends the different parcels to create a final wine that showcases the unique characteristics of the Shiraz grown on our property, with a balance and structure that is truly exceptional.
Vintage
With cool and dry weather, the 2021 vintage in the Clare Valley produced lovely fruit with excellent varietal character and natural acidity. The cool growing season was preceded by late-winter and early-spring rains which allowed for good spring growth on the vines. This was followed by below average rainfall and dry conditions for the remainder of the season, resulting in a vintage that produced beautiful and classic Clare wines with smaller bunches and grapes therefore reducing yield.

        <title>Harvest Gold 2016</title>
        <description>Our Harvest Gold is a medium-sweet late harvest wine crafted from Riesling grapes grown on carefully managed low-yielding vines on our family-owned Skillogalee estate in the Clare Valley. It is produced by leaving the grapes on the vine for a prolonged period after typical harvest, resulting in increased concentration of sugar, acidity, and flavour due to evaporation of the water in the grapes.
Description
With lifted aromas of lemon curd, freshly baked pastry, lime marmalade and navel orange blossoms. The palate is finely balanced between intense concentrated fruit flavours of pomelo, custard apples and guava, and natural sweetness complemented by crisp cleansing natural acidity. Enjoy with cheese, fruit based desserts and also lightly spiced and fragrant South East Asian cuisine.
Winemaking
Our small winemaking team strives to produce a unique expression of the terroir in Harvest Gold by carefully considering both the influence of the vineyard&amp;rsquo;s location and the winemaking techniques used. The result is a wine with a rich sweetness, bright acidity, and a distinct character that can be enjoyed on its own or paired with desserts or cheeses.
Vintage
The 2016 vintage in the Clare Valley benefited from a good growing season following a successful previous year. Winter 2015 was cold initially, but late rains in August accompanied by milder conditions allowed vines to store extra nutrients. Mild and dry early spring led to early bud burst and rapid vine growth, tracking ahead of a normal season. Flowering was mostly complete by November, aided by good post-flowering rains and the absence of spring frost. The period between November and January was dry, increasing water consumption and causing some vineyards to struggle. However, timely rainfall in late January and early February relieved stress and slowed down ripening, allowing for optimal harvest of vineyard parcels. The overall quality of Shiraz and Riesling is outstanding, and the crush saw a 25% increase compared to the previous year, with solid fruit quantities across all varieties.

        <title>Liqueur Muscat</title>
        <description>Nestled alongside the scenic creek, below our historic cottage restaurant and cellar door, ancient Muscat vines flourish. These extraordinary vines produce the grapes that form the soul of our Skillogalee Liqueur Muscat. Having thrived for decades, they are an integral part of our estate&amp;rsquo;s unique terroir.
Description
Our Liqueur Muscat is meticulously crafted, following a time-honoured process akin to that used for tawny port. We select and blend various vintages of delectable sweet wines, each individually fermented and fortified. This intricate blend then ages gracefully for years, even decades, in oak puncheons using the traditional solera method. While released as a non-vintage wine, each bottle contains a blend of Muscat that goes back many decades, capturing a moment in time.
As for the title of &amp;ldquo;Liqueur Muscat&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s not merely decorative. By law, a wine must contain at least 17% alcohol and 11% residual sugar to earn the &amp;lsquo;liqueur&amp;rsquo; prefix. Our Muscat not only meets these stringent criteria but exceeds them, offering a truly indulgent experience that engages all the senses.
Tasting Notes
The current blend is a harmonious composition of vintages from various decades. Older material contributes the irresistible rancio characters of nutty, apricot loveliness, and butterscotch, while younger wines lend a sense of freshness and vitality.
Visually striking, the wine presents a vibrant red-amber hue, while its aroma captivates with a hint of sweet young raisins. As you take a sip, your palate is embraced by a rich tapestry of flavours, including nutty raisin and sun-ripened apricot. Though delightfully full and sweet, it sidesteps being overly cloying.
The result is a fortified wine with complex character &amp;mdash; rich, sweet, and elevated in alcohol content. The finish is the pi&amp;egrave;ce de r&amp;eacute;sistance: a lingering, smooth experience that leaves an indelible liqueur-like impression.

        <title>Small Batch Cabernet Franc 2022</title>
        <description>Our Small Batch Cabernet Franc is handcrafted from a tiny parcel of hand-managed, dry-grown vines on the hillside slopes of our single-estate property in the heart of the Clare Valley. These old, low-yielding grape vines, from our original plantings located in the gully in front of our cellar door, produce fruit with refined sensory characteristics that showcase the elegant nature of Cabernet Franc.
Description
The wine is a medium to deep red ruby colour. On the nose, it has aromas of lifted violets, dark berries such as black currant, plum and black cherry along with subtle notes of cedar, tobacco and a hint of green bell pepper. On the palate, it is medium-bodied with flavours of dark fruit and a touch of earthy and herbal undertones. It also has a good acidity, firm tannins and a long finish.
A lovely pairing with many food styles including grilled meats, rich pasta dishes or cheese. Stunning and ready-to-drink now, but also with graceful aging potential for many years to come.
Winemaking
Hand-harvested grapes are specifically chosen to produce a stylish wine with beautiful fruit character and varietal expression. The fruit is fermented in small open fermenters, before being gently basket-pressed to extract the complex and structured wine. The wine is then matured for 8-months in French oak to retain the vibrant fruit flavours and acidity. Before being bottled, the barrels are individually tasted by our small winemaking team and to blend a balanced and structured wine which highlights the unique and distinctive characteristics of the variety.
Vintage
The 2022 vintage was one of outstanding quality, with delicate concentration of flavour and structure &amp;ndash; producing truly great wines. Ample winter and spring rainfall ensured good soil moisture for our dry-grown vines, while the cool, dry weather through summer and early autumn provided ideal ripening conditions to produce fruit with high natural acidity and beautiful varietal flavour. The slow start and belated budburst, in combination with the cooler summer, resulted in one of the latest starts to harvest in more than a decade.

        <title>Small Batch Collection</title>
        <description>Discover the distinct qualities of Skillogalee with our limited-edition Small Batch Collection. This special set features 2 bottles each of our Small Batch Malbec, Grenache, and Cabernet Franc, all crafted with meticulous care to offer a unique and unforgettable flavour profile.
Our Small Batch Malbec originates from dry-grown plantings in the gully that fronts our cellar door. This wine captures the eye with its deep, inky purple hue and engages the senses with aromas of lifted violets, fresh florals, and dark fruits like blackcurrant, blackberry, and plum. Accents of spice, leather and tobacco add complexity. The palate reveals brooding fruit flavours and fine tannins that bring structure and balance. It's a perfect match for hearty meats and rich sauces.
Explore into the intricate nature of our Small Batch Grenache, carefully created from hand-harvested, dry-grown vines in historic vineyard blocks around our Sevenhill estate. Whole berry fermentation amplifies the beautiful strawberry and red fruit notes. The wine greets you with a bright ruby red colour and offers rose petal aromas and a soft texture. It showcases ripe red fruits like strawberries and cherries, complemented by a touch of floral spice. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, marked by lively acidity and gentle tannins.
Lastly, enjoy the sophistication of Skillogalee's Small Batch Cabernet Franc. This wine comes from a select parcel of hand-managed, dry-grown vines on our estate's hillside slopes. Aromas of lifted violets, dark berries such as black currant, plum, and black cherry harmonise with subtle notes of cedar, tobacco and a touch of green bell pepper. The palate features a medium-bodied profile with dark fruit flavours, earthy and herbal undertones, firm tannins, and good acidity, all culminating in a long finish.</description>

        <title>Small Batch Grenache 2023</title>
        <description>Our limited-edition Small Batch Grenache is expertly crafted from hand-harvested, dry-grown vines sourced from historic vineyard blocks around our estate in Sevenhill. These Grenache vines are survivors &amp;mdash; this wine is crafted from grapes grown on individual ancestor vines that have steadfastly remained Grenache when the rest of the vineyard was grafted to alternate varieties many decades ago.
Description
Whole berry fermentation enhances the lovely strawberry and red fruit flavours of this very pretty wine. Made in a fresh and crunchy style with rose petal aromas and a soft texture. The wine presents with a bright ruby red colour in the glass. On the nose, there are aromas of ripe red fruits, such as strawberries and cherries, with a hint of floral spice. On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied with lively acidity and a soft tannic structure.
Winemaking
This wine is made from grapes that are harvested separately and then, after cold soaking, undergo small batch fermentation before the skins are gently basket-pressed to maintain the delicate fruit characters. The wine is then aged for 6 months in French oak barrels to preserve its fresh fruit flavours and acidity. The winemaking team expertly blends the wine to highlight the elegance and complexity of the Grenache grapes resulting in a wine with bright, fruity flavours and a structured finish.
Vintage
The 2023 vintage in Clare Valley was characterised by astute vineyard management and keen weather monitoring. Following the most substantial winter-spring precipitation since 2016, a postponed budburst and restrained spring growth marked the season&amp;rsquo;s onset. December saw the commencement of flowering, paving the way for a March harvesting period. Despite the presence of challenges, including heightened moisture levels and sporadic hail events heightening disease risk, a notably dry spell from Christmas to March facilitated an excellent Riesling harvest. These wines showcased remarkable flavour maturity alongside harmonious acidity.

Description
Whole berry fermentation enhances the beautiful floral spice and red fruit flavours of this silky-textured wine. Made in a style not dissimilar to Pinot Noir, it's a fresh and lifted style with gorgeous floral aromas and a soft, silky texture. The wine presents a bright ruby red colour in the glass. The palate is medium-bodied with lively acidity and is loaded with brooding fruit flavours and fine, lingering tannins that provide structure and balance.
Winemaking
The grapes are hand-harvested together in the field, before undergoing cold soaking and small-batch vinification in open fermenters. The skins are then gently basket-pressed to preserve the delicate character, and the wine is matured in French oak barrels for six months to retain fresh fruit flavours and acidity. The winemaking team carefully tastes and selects barrels to create a final product that showcases the unique characteristics of this new blend from grapes grown on our property, with a balance and structure that is truly exceptional.
Vintage
The 2023 vintage was one of strong quality, with a full concentration of flavour and structure, producing flavoursome wines. Ample winter and spring rainfall ensured adequate soil moisture for our dry-grown vines. The cool weather through summer, with regular rainfall top-ups, provided longer ripening conditions to produce fruit with high natural acidity and beautiful varietal flavour. The slow start and belated budburst, combined with the cooler summer, resulted in one of the latest and slowest starts to harvest in more than a decade.

        <title>Sparkling Riesling</title>
        <description>Our family-owned boutique winery has been producing Sparkling Riesling since 1987, right in the heart of Clare Valley, Australia&amp;rsquo;s Riesling paradise. Our journey began with a dream to craft a sparkling wine that was not only a joy to drink, but truly represents the unique terroir of our dry-grown estate vineyards, nestled near Sevenhill. These vines, planted in the 1970s on sloping hillsides, benefit from the cool, high-elevation climate, yielding grapes that encapsulate expressive, vibrant flavours.
Description
In every glass of our Sparkling Riesling, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover the essence of our passion, the richness of Clare Valley&amp;rsquo;s soil, and over three decades of evolving history. Our Sparkling Riesling is perfect for any occasion &amp;ndash; whether enjoyed alone, as part of a celebration, as an aperitif with nibbles, or paired with fresh seafood like oysters, prawns, and lobster. Its versatility and delightful taste make it an ideal companion for times when you would typically enjoy champagne.
Winemaking
Our winemaking approach blends tradition with meticulous craftsmanship. The grapes for our Sparkling Riesling are hand-picked from our venerable vines, ensuring only the finest quality in each bottle. In our winery, we transform these precious grapes into a wine that exhilarates the senses before it undergoes a second fermentation process to become a sparkling wine. Each sip offers a burst of citrus zest and a bouquet of floral aromatics, followed by a crisp, dry finish. The wine&amp;rsquo;s light, refreshing character, coupled with a fine bead and creamy mousse, makes it a delightful experience.
Non-Vintage
Our dedicated winemaking team expertly blends select cuv&amp;eacute;es from various vintages, creating a non-vintage Sparkling Riesling that embodies harmony and consistent excellence. This approach not only showcases the venerable Riesling varietal but also ensures that each bottle delivers a consistent, high-quality flavour profile, year after year, unaffected by the natural variances of individual vintages.

        <title>Take Two 2015</title>
        <description>The 2015 Take Two, our eigth release, is a specially crafted Australian red blend of estate-grown Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, designed to offer a softer, more accessible style than our standard label reds. Minimally processed to preserve the bright primary fruit characteristics, balanced acidity, and smooth tannin structure, the wine undergoes fermentation in open tanks and is then gently basket-pressed. Aging occurs in both seasoned and new American and French oak barrels, enhancing the wine&amp;rsquo;s complexity. It presents a vibrant bouquet of purple fruits, accented with hints of mocha, pepper, allspice, and a touch of dusty oak. On the palate, it is plush and rounded, with well-integrated tannins and layers of boysenberry and blackberry, elegantly complemented by restrained oak nuances.
Vintage
The 2015 Clare Valley vintage concluded impressively for Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon after an almost ideal growing season marked by above-average winter rainfall and a trouble-free spring, despite some isolated frost incidents. A mild early summer, followed by a hot February, prompted an early harvest, commencing 2-3 weeks earlier than usual. This season produced wines with excellent varietal definition, rich flavour, strong structure, and robust natural acidity, indicating significant longevity potential. While the compact nature of the vintage required careful prioritisation, the generally mild conditions preserved the quality of the fruit. Yields were robust, with both Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon showing great resilience and productivity. This vintage is celebrated as one of the best in the last decade for these varietals, continuing a string of successful years since 2011.

        <description>The 2016 Take Two is the ninth release of our classic Australian red blend, designed to be softer and more approachable than our standard label reds. This blend of estate-grown Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon is minimally handled to preserve its vibrant primary fruit characters, balanced acidity, and refined tannin structure. Using open fermenters and basket pressing, the wine is then matured in both old and new American and French oak barrels. It boasts a lifted bouquet of purple fruits with nuances of mocha, pepper, allspice, and dusty oak. The palate is soft, round, and seductive, displaying fine-grained, well-integrated tannins and bright notes of boysenberry and blackberry with restrained oak influence.
Vintage
The 2016 vintage in the Clare Valley was favourable for Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, following a successful season the previous year. The winter of 2015 began cold, but late rains in August and milder conditions helped the vines store essential nutrients. A mild and dry early spring led to early bud burst and rapid growth, accelerating the season's progress. Flowering was largely complete by November, supported by good post-flowering rains and no spring frost. A dry spell from November to January increased water demands, challenging some vineyards, but timely rains in late January and early February alleviated stress and moderated the ripening process, ensuring an optimal harvest. The quality of both Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon was outstanding, benefiting from these well-managed conditions.

        <title>Take Two 2018</title>
        <description>Discover the rich, soft, and inviting character of Take Two, a classic Australian blend of Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. First released in 2003, this wine was envisioned as a celebration of two generations at the helm of Skillogalee. Each vintage of &amp;lsquo;Take Two&amp;rsquo; showcases its distinct character, with the blend ratios varying, yet consistently forming a harmonious union of estate-grown Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon.
Description
A lifted bouquet of purple fruits leads to hints of mocha, pepper, allspice and dusty oak. The palate is soft, round and seductive, with bright fruit characters of boysenberry, blackberry and restrained oak. The tannins are fine gained and well integrated. This is wine is crafted to be ready to drink when it&amp;rsquo;s released, but will continue to develop further with careful ageing.
Winemaking
This striking combination is crafted through precise small-batch vinification in open fermenters and the gentle basket pressing of the skins. The wine is then aged gracefully for two years in a mix of French and American oak hogsheads, culminating in a depth of flavour and complexity that is both memorable and approachable. Enjoy the lavish berry sweetness and the elegant balance that &amp;lsquo;Take Two&amp;rsquo; brings to every glass.
Vintage
The 2018 vintage can be summed up as a long dry growing season, which started with low moisture in the soil due to previous winter and spring both also both being dry with below average annual rainfall of only about 500mm. This was combined with above average temperatures throughout the season, rather than any specific heatwave. While this weather meant yields for 2018 were down on the previous vintage, the fruit produced this season was incredibly rich and concentrated producing wines of outstanding quality and character.

        <title>The Cabernets 2009</title>
        <description>The 2009 The Cabernets blend, consisting of 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Malbec, and 2% Cabernet Franc, is a testament to the Skillogalee tradition of crafting dark, rich wines. It boasts an intense colour and exudes powerful, vibrant aromas and flavours. The palate is full and elegant, layered with notes of cassis, cherry fruit, and black olives. Fine vanillin oak and firm structural tannins enhance the complexity and allure of this distinguished wine.
Vintage
The 2009 vintage in the Clare Valley was marked by optimal climatic conditions, yielding a season celebrated for its vibrant fruit flavours, particularly in Cabernet Sauvignon, which thrived under the extended mild weather. The growing season commenced with robust vine growth, fuelled by high soil moisture from previous rains. Flowering was supported by timely December rains, setting the stage for average yields. Although a late January heatwave briefly stalled vine activity, the subsequent mild days and cool nights fostered even veraison and moderate sugar levels, reminiscent of the cooler 2005 season. The unhurried harvest spanned from late February to May, allowing flavours to develop fully, culminating in a range of wines noted for their depth and liveliness, with Cabernet Sauvignon standing out for its exceptional flavour maturity.

        <title>The Cabernets 2016</title>
        <description>The 2016 The Cabernets, a blend of 96% Cabernet Sauvignon, 2% Malbec, and 2% Cabernet Franc, offers a complex bouquet of lifted blackcurrant and cassis, enriched by subtle undertones of chocolate and blueberry. The palate is both generous and medium-bodied, characterized by finely grained, mouth-coating tannins and a long, persistent finish. While immediately enjoyable, this wine's natural acid backbone and well-integrated tannins promise excellent ageing potential, ensuring it will continue to develop and reward with careful cellaring.
Vintage
The 2016 vintage was shaped by timely rainfall, with 40mm falling in the final week of January, followed by an additional 11mm on February 3rd, which refreshed the vineyards and provided essential moisture for the fruit to ripen optimally. The remainder of February saw very mild conditions, 1.2 degrees cooler than average, fostering a slow and steady ripening process. This allowed our team to harvest vineyard parcels precisely when the fruit had reached its peak. The forty-year-old vines, being dry-grown and deep-rooted, benefited greatly from these conditions, enabling the fruit to develop rich flavours and colour consistently and harmoniously.

        <title>Trevarrick Cabernet 2021</title>
        <description>&amp;ldquo;Trevarrick Farm&amp;rdquo; was the original name of our property when it was first settled by John and Anne Trestrail in the 1850s. More than a century later in 1970, vines were planted on this magnificent land and established the Skillogalee vineyards. Our grapes are carefully hand-picked from each contour block on the Skillogalee estate, with the Trevarrick name reserved for wines crafted from select contours that showcase exceptional quality and varietal character.
Description
With a deep ruby colour, aromas of black currant, black cherry, and cassis, along with notes of tobacco, cedar and a hint of vanilla, this wine has a rich, full-bodied palate with firm tannins and a long, smooth finish. It is perfect to pair with red meats, hearty stews, and mature cheeses. Luxurious drinking now, or may be cellared for 10-20 years or more, developing secondary flavours and aromas over time.
Winemaking
The Trevarrick Cabernet Sauvignon is a wine of unique quality and character, produced from a single contour vineyard on the high-elevation hillside slopes of our property. This iconic and undulating land, with its varied combination of soil, topography, viticulture, sunlight and temperature, results in a diverse selection of premium quality grapes from which we create our wines. The final blend is carefully tasted and chosen by our winemaking team to showcase the essence of Skillogalee.
Vintage
With cool and dry weather, the 2021 vintage in the Clare Valley produced lovely fruit with excellent varietal character and natural acidity. The cool growing season was preceded by late-winter and early-spring rains which allowed for good spring growth on the vines. This was followed by below average rainfall and dry conditions for the remainder of the season, resulting in a vintage that produced beautiful and classic Clare wines with smaller bunches and grapes therefore reducing yield.

        <title>Trevarrick Cabernet Franc 2021</title>
        <description>The 2021 Trevarrick Cabernet Franc is a testament to its noble grape origins, presenting lifted aromas of violets and red berry fruits. This medium-bodied wine reveals a fresh, bright core of dark fruit on the palate, enhanced by earthy and herbal nuances. The well-structured profile includes lovely acidity, firm tannins, and a long, elegant finish. Grown in the gully near our cellar door, the mature, low-yielding vines yield fruit that distinctly embodies the varietal's graceful character. Matured in French oak, the wine gains subtle oak notes that complement its vibrant fruit flavours and hallmark acidity, resulting in a beautifully balanced and expressive Cabernet Franc.
Vintage
The 2021 vintage in Clare Valley was defined by cool and dry conditions that fostered a significant recovery in yields for red varieties, particularly notable in Cabernet Franc. Enhanced by adequate rainfall during late winter and early spring, the vines experienced even budburst and healthy canopy growth, effectively reducing frost risks. The growing season, while dry, concluded with a successful flowering in November, producing larger than expected bunch and berry sizes across most red varieties. The resultant Cabernet Franc fruit displayed excellent varietal character and acidity, attesting to the quality of the vintage. With minimal disease pressure and efficient management of vineyard operations, the 2021 vintage has been marked by a strong expression of terroir and holds great promise, especially for the red varieties such as Cabernet Franc, which have rebounded well from previous drought conditions.

        <description>The 2022 vintage was one of outstanding quality, with delicate concentration of flavour and structure &amp;ndash; producing truly great wines. Ample winter and spring rainfall ensured good soil moisture for our dry-grown vines, while the cool, dry weather through summer and early autumn provided ideal ripening conditions to produce fruit with high natural acidity and beautiful varietal flavour. The slow start and belated budburst, in combination with the cooler summer, resulted in one of the latest starts to harvest in more than a decade.
Crisp and lively, this generous wine offers elegant acidity invigorated by a clean zing of citrus and balanced mineral notes, tightly focussed structure and rocky succulent core. The bright flavours, natural acidity and a graceful structure display the unique terroir of our ancient soil and spectacular topography. With careful cellaring this wine should mature gracefully for ten+ years.

        <title>Trevarrick Riesling 2023</title>
        <description>Trevarrick Farm was the original name of our property when it was first settled by John and Anne Trestrail in the 1850s. More than a century later in 1970, vines were planted on this magnificent land and the Skillogalee vineyards were established. When we harvest the grapes, each individual contour block on the estate picked and handled individually, the Trevarrick name is reserved for those contours which exhibit exceptional quality and varietal character of the vintage.
Description
Bright and dynamic, this opulent wine boasts a refined acidity, enlivened by a pure burst of citrus and harmonious mineral nuances, a sharply defined structure, and a robust, rocky core. The vivid flavours, inherent acidity, and poised framework are a testament to the distinctive terroir of our age-old soil and the dramatic landscape. This wine, with its potential for over a decade of graceful maturation, promises to evolve exquisitely with thoughtful cellaring.
Winemaking
The grapes for the Trevarrick Riesling are hand selected and hand-harvested from some of the highest altitude, slowest ripening contours on the property, at around 500m above sea level. The stony, thin soils and topography of this part of the vineyard produce unique, high-quality grapes bursting with varietal character. Trevarrick showcases the essence of Skillogalee.
Vintage
The 2023 vintage highlights the art of precision in vineyard care and keen weather attentiveness. A particularly wet winter-spring led to a slower onset of the growing season, culminating in well-timed flowering and a March harvest. This period nurtured our white varieties, particularly Riesling and Gew&amp;uuml;rztraminer, with minimal rainfall from Christmas to March contributing to their remarkable flavour development and ideal acidity. Despite early challenges, the resilience and care in cultivation shone through, presenting wines that truly embody the celebrated terroir of Clare Valley.

        <title>Trevarrick Shiraz 2015</title>
        <description>The 2015 Trevarrick Shiraz captivates with its attractive crimson robe accented by purple highlights. The nose bursts with vibrant aromas of black cherry, mulberry, and black pepper, along with enticing notes of pan juices. On the palate, this Shiraz is both medium-bodied and richly sumptuous, featuring a complex array of flavours including coffee, roasting herbs, and black olive, complemented by boysenberry and a refreshing hint of spearmint on the finish. This Shiraz also possesses a robust tannin and acid structure that promises excellent ageing potential, maturing gracefully over the next 10 to 15 years.
Vintage
The 2015 vintage in Clare Valley concluded on a high note for Shiraz, following an almost ideal growing season with above-average winter rainfall and a trouble-free spring, despite some isolated frost damage. A mild early summer, followed by a hot February, precipitated an early start to the harvest, about 2-3 weeks ahead of the usual schedule. The Shiraz from this vintage is showcasing fantastic varietal definition with great flavour, robust structure, and excellent natural acidity, all suggesting significant longevity potential. While the compact nature of the vintage required careful prioritisation in harvesting, the generally mild conditions ensured the maintenance of high fruit quality. Overall, the yields were at least average, with Shiraz showing resilience in productivity. This vintage is regarded as one of the best in the last decade for Clare Valley Shiraz, continuing a streak of successful years since the challenging 2011 season.

        <title>Trevarrick Shiraz 2021</title>
        <description>&amp;ldquo;Trevarrick Farm&amp;rdquo; was the original name of our property when it was first settled by John and Anne Trestrail in the 1850s. More than a century later in 1970, vines were planted on this magnificent land and the Skillogalee vineyards were established. When we harvest the grapes, each individual contour block on the estate picked and handled individually, the Trevarrick name is reserved for those contours which exhibit exceptional quality and varietal character of the vintage.
Description
The wine has a luxurious, rich, crimson colour along with a complex and layered nose that showcases the terroir and winemaking with notes of dark fruit (blackberry, black cherry), spices (black pepper, cloves) and a subtle floral or herbaceous character. The palate shows lifted berry fruit flavours of mulberry and dark fruit spice with a concentrated rich fruit core and long mouth-coating tannin.
The wine is crafted in a way that it can be enjoyed thoroughly upon release, but has the tannin and acid structure to mature gracefully for ten+ years.
Winemaking
The Trevarrick Shiraz is the produced from these single contour vineyards on the high-elevation hillside slopes of the Skillogalee Estate in the Clare Valley. This unique and undulating land, with its varied combination of soil, topography, viticulture, sunlight and temperature, results in a diverse selection of premium quality grapes from which we create our wines. Trevarrick showcases the essence of Skillogalee.
Vintage
With cool and dry weather, the 2021 vintage in the Clare Valley produced lovely fruit with excellent varietal character and natural acidity. The cool growing season was preceded by late-winter and early-spring rains which allowed for good spring growth on the vines. This was followed by below average rainfall and dry conditions for the remainder of the season, resulting in a vintage that produced beautiful and classic Clare wines with smaller bunches and grapes therefore reducing yield.
