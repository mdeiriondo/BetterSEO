        <title>2016 Estate Selection</title>
        <description>The 2016 Estate Selection is representative of all five red Bordeaux varieties. The selection process starts in the vineyard and continues on through the winemaking process: only the best lots make the final blend. All blocks were harvested &amp; fermented separately. The individual components were blended after 12 months in barrel. Total time in 225-liter French oak barrels was 26 months.</description>

        <title>2017 Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description> 
VINTAGE NOTES
A mild winter and spring advanced bud break at Crown Point, followed by only seven 100+ degree days. We classify 2017 as a warm vintage but not extremely hot, with a final heatwave at the end of October. Our nighttime temperatures were cooler, with lows in the 50s throughout September and October. As a result, the minimal days over 100 degrees allowed ripening to occur gradually, providing integrated, fine-grain tannin accumulation, and a consistent maturation.
WINEMAKER TASTING NOTES
Our purpose with this wine is to feature our hillside vineyard and its synergy with Cabernet Sauvignon. The higher elevation combined with an increased rock content brought a tension into the wines that balance the heat and sunshine. We notice the California clones adapt well to the Mediterranean conditions in this warm year. The clones that provide the backbone to this wine are Clone 8 - defined by its fresh fruit character, tracing back to Chateau Margaux - and To Kalon Clone 2 - infamous To Kalon vineyard selection in Napa delivering spice &amp; concentration.  Marked by its intensity, there are complex notes of cherries, blackberries, and floral tones in harmony with our trademark savoriness. A wine that can be appreciated now or for the next 20 years. </description>

        <title>2018 Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description> 
VINTAGE NOTESA temperate winter and mild spring gave way to a bud break that started in line with the seasonal average at Crown Point. June was warm (the 80s) and July warmer (consistently in the 90s), creating an early water deficit in the vineyard that mitigated berry size. There were only six 100-degree days pre-veraison and none following. The limited 100-degree days allowed the vines to ripen fruit void of heatwaves. The result is a classic vintage enabling the perfect flavor accumulation and tannin ripeness. Ultimately, the growing season reminisces of our fantastic 2016 vintage.
WINEMAKER NOTESThe wine offers profuse aromas of blackberry, cassis, and dark plum. Elegant notes of violets, white pepper, and rose petals follow, and together they deliver a very seductive bouquet. The seamlessly layered flavors build to a crescendo of fresh and juicy black fruit, accented with hints of orange zest, licorice, and dark chocolate. Beautifully balanced, the smooth round tannins and acidity deliver a long persistent finish.</description>

WINEMAKER TASTING NOTES
Intense aromas of chocolate, black cherry, and raspberry intermingle with savory notes of sage and thyme. The tannins are lithe, intertwining with flavors of black cherry, coffee grounds, and crushed rocks. The 2018 Estate Selection has a perfect balance of fresh acidity followed by bright fruit and minerality that extend the finish, foreshadowing significant aging potential.</description>

        <title>2019 Estate Selection</title>
        <description>VINTAGE2019 was a fascinating vintage at Crown Point, where we experienced a mild, wet winter with delayed flowering and harvest. A warmer summer followed with eleven days above 700 degrees from June through September, and ripening accelerated, providing an attractive sweetness to the wine. October offered a respite for the vines and extended hangtime with temperatures consistently in the 80s. While the summer heatwave marks the vintage, the cooler weather allowed the vines to recover and gracefully adapt.
WINEMAKER NOTESA reflection of site, the blend' s personality transcends the five Bordeaux varieties and offers an intimate expression of our terroir. We pick each block separately and ferment in four-ton French oak and concrete fermenters. With a 30-day fermentation average, we drain and raise the wine to barrels for 22 months - 50% new and 50% once used. The wine emanates blueberry and black currant notes in concert with savory herbal tones. This vintage offers a powerful structure that is beautifully juxtaposed with a smooth texture. Ultimately, it is an incredible wine to enjoy now and will age gracefully for decades.</description>
