Cabernet Sauvignon was harvested at 24 brix
Cabernet Franc was harvested at 24.5 brix. 


All of these wines were fermented in stainless steel tanks with three pumpovers on a daily basis.
Aged in barrels for 19 months

Cabernet Sauvignon was aged 50% in New American Oak and 50% in Neutral Oak
Cabernet Franc was aged entirely in New American Oak
