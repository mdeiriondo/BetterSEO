        <title>20 Year Old Port</title>
        <description>Winemaking Notes:Produced from 100% Napa Valley fruit and made in the traditional port style. Our 20-year old Port comes from a blend of several Port wines made with traditional Port varieties- Tinta Cao Tinta Madera Souzao and Touriga Nacional.The wine was bottled after aging in small oak casks for a minimum of 20 years although some are more than twenty five years in barrel. It’s tawny plum color and caramelized aromas come from the long aging process in barrels giving the wine a unique spicy character and sweet oak tones to go along with the cocoa raspberry and milk chocolate bouquet.  The lively acidity and berry flavors pair with aged cheeses (especially blue cheese) and charcuterie with other savory foods like roasted meats and game. Red port with rare duck breast or duck confit is delicious also.</description>

        <title>2003 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>VINEYARD NOTESThis wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench” below Mt. St. John in the Mayacamas range. Gary is a third-generation farmer in a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained Bale Clay Loam gravelly soils producing fine- grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-west by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993. </description>

        <title>2005 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Grown in the foothills of the Mayacamas mountains in the upper reaches our Henry Ranch estate, our Mt. Veeder Cabernet, with a touch of Petite Verdot, has distinctive blueberry, tobacco and black olive flavors that are ripe and complex. Poor, acidic soils and the mountain environment create a more tightly-wound, focused flavor profile and firm, yet fine-grained tannins.Vineyard Notes:The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allow the fruit to mature slowly in this Estate property allowing the development of incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <title>2006 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Located in the rugged Mayacamas Mountains at elevations ranging from 1250-1400 ft., our Mt. Veeder Estate is situated in a unique microclimate offering cooler temperatures during the day with warmer temperatures at night. Planted on ancient marine soils, the fruit in this vineyard develops slowly and steadily until full phenolic ripeness is reached. Often the very last of our vineyards to be harvested; our Mt. Veeder Estate offers small yields of deeply pigmented, intensely flavored fruit which produce wines of complexity, power and elegance that speak to their provenance year after year.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2007 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vittorio's Vineyard about thirty acres adjacent to the winery on the south side is planted about half to Cabernet Sauvignon. The soils are gravelly loam and marginally fertile which stresses the vines and produces excellent quality grapes. The vineyard enjoys a microclimate that is perfectly suited to Cabernet and the four other varieties (Merlot Petit Verdot Syrah &amp; Zinfandel) planted there. Vines are spaced 2 x 4 which causes the root balls to compete with one another and they are trained to a vertical curtain. The vines are stressed to the point where we take a European farming approach with our workers making three passes through the vineyard towards the latter part of the season to drop (or thin) clusters so that the vines can fully ripen their load.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <title>2008 Paradiso</title>
        <description>This premium proprietary blend which we have named Paradiso (Pahr-a DEEZ-0h) consists of Cabernet Sauvignon (89%) Merlot (8%) and Petit Verdot (3%).  The Cabernet Sauvignon comes from Preston Vineyard one of our top Rutherford Appellation vineyards while the Merlot is from our Henry Ranch and finally the Petit Verdot is from the excellent &quot;Vittorio's Vineyard&quot; adjacent to the winery in St. Helena.  The dusty mocha and cassis-filled Rutherford Cabernet combines with cool-climate elegant Carneros Merlot which is then topped off with the inky cedary aromatic Vittorio's Vineyard Petit Verdot. Ripe black cherry fruit hints of coffee and cocoa black currant in the nose - it shows fruit and tannin structure and complexity that portends excellent long-term age worthiness.  &quot;We are trying to achieve a clear balance and harmony among the components&quot; says Brooks Painter Director of Winemaking.  &quot;The different attributes of each grape engage masterfully with one another to create an extremely enjoyable drinking experience - a real marvel of a wine.  After 18 months of bottle age it has developed a very interesting and complex bouquet and depth of flavors that will deliver in the nose and on the palate.  We're extremely pleased with the result - Enjoy!&quot;(Limit: 3 per person)</description>

        <title>2008 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity.  The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.(Limit: 2 per person)&quot;...it's exceptionally ripe in blackberry and cherry fruit with a liqueur richness of crème de cassis and it should have no trouble in the cellar.&quot; - Wine Enthusiast</description>

        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vittorio's Vineyard about thirty acres adjacent to the winery on the south side is planted about half to Cabernet Sauvignon. The soils are gravelly loam and marginally fertile which stresses the vines and produces excellent quality grapes. The vineyard enjoys a microclimate that is perfectly suited to Cabernet and the four other varieties (Merlot Petit Verdot Syrah &amp; Zinfandel) planted there.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2009 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench”. Gary is a third-generation farmer on this property a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained gravelly soils which produce fine-grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-west by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993.</description>

        <title>2009 Paradiso</title>
        <description>Most of the Cabernet Sauvignon comes from Preston Vineyard one of our top Rutherford Appellation vineyards with the rest of the Cabernet from the new Coombsville AVA and Mt Veeder. The Merlot is from our Henry Ranch estate in Los Carneros and the Petit Verdot is from our estate Vittorio's Vineyard adjacent to the winery in St. Helena. The dusty Rutherford fruit combines beautifully with the other cool-climate Cabernet lots while the Carneros Merlot brings red cherry aromas and supple tannins.  A small amount of the cedary aromatic Vittorio's Vineyard Petit Verdot brings a mineral aspect and backbone and intensity to the composition. An altogether elegant blend that is glorious now and will age wonderfully for several years to come.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2009 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

St. John on the western edge of the renowned Rutherford Bench from which many of Napa Valley's finest Cabernets are born. The bench land is slightly elevated and considerably flat with gravelly and sandy loam deposited from millennia of ancient creeks meandering through it on the way to the river. The vineyard is almost entirely organic and no herbicides are ever applied.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2010 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>125th Anniversary Vintage &quot;The Morisoli Vineyard has long been one of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards in the Napa Valley and it consistently produces one of the strongest Cabs in the V. Sattui arsenal. This beautiful wine is rich and dense on the palate with a nose of cassis and ripe blackberry and spice. The oak is beautifully judged lending warmth and a hint of spice. This smooth supple gem of a Cab took gold at the Winemaker Challenge International Wine Competition in San Diego recently.&quot;</description>

        <title>2010 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Some of California's most sought-after and expensive wines come out of the Rutherford AVA the historical core of the Napa Valley and from where V. Sattui has been producing Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignons for more than thirty-three years. Cabernet performs marvelously here giving sumptuous wines of great profundity and longevity; and its preeminence here is no new idea. Gustave Niebaum's 19th-century Inglenook made Cabernets in 1887-89 that still survive and Georges de Latour knew in 1900 that his BV Cabernets had world class results as well. Preston Vineyard is but a stone's throw from these great estates.It's thought that the secret to Rutherford Cabernet lies in the gravelly loam soil and the well-drained bench lands at the foot of the Mayacamas Mountains just west of the town of Rutherford. 'Rutherford dust' is the catchword for the particular character imparted by sun and soil here; and it's no mistake that vintage after vintage the compelling trait in our Preston Cabernets is its dusty leathery cigar-box quality that frames the delicious fruit that we always receive from this coveted 28-acre parcel.Vineyard Notes:Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity. The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <description>Vittorio's Vineyard about thirty acres adjacent to the winery on the south side is planted about half to Cabernet Sauvignon. The soils are gravelly loam and marginally fertile which stresses the vines and produces excellent quality grapes. The vineyard enjoys a microclimate that is perfectly suited to Cabernet and the four other varieties (Merlot Petit Verdot Syrah &amp; Zinfandel) planted there.</description>

        <title>2011 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>&quot;Rich and slightly chewy V. Sattui's 2011 Preston Vineyard Cab is a Cab lover's Cabernet. Dense and layered it shows ripe dark fruits supported by firm tannins that will need another two to three years to come around. Those who have the patience to cellar this big bad Napa red should hold it until at least 2018 but 2021 to 2025 would be optimum. Though richly extracted the Preston is well balanced and inviting now even though it will not hit its peak for some time. This wine was awarded a platinum medal at the 2014 Sommelier Challenge wine competition.&quot;</description>

        <title>2011 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>This vintage is 84% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot with a finishing dose of Malbec and Syrah. The Cabernet Petit Verdot and Syrah come from our Vittorio's Vineyard. We have six Cabernet blocks about two acres each with different clones including Clone 6 (also known as the Jackson clone which produces small berries loose clusters and very concentrated fruit). The Malbec comes from our Carsi Vineyard in Yountville and gives additional color and intensity to the blend.Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton Loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <title>2012 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench”. Gary is a third-generation farmer on this property a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained gravelly soils which produce fine-grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-west by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993.(Limit: 6 per person)</description>

        <description>&quot;Winemaker Brooks Painter and his crew always bring out all that Morisoli has to offer and in this vintage it's lively raspberry fruit joined perfectly by pie spice mild dried herbs cedar and cigar. It's got a big structured backbone that begs further aging while providing great delight at present. Decant or go long? You win either way.&quot;</description>

        <title>2012 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Deep aromas of blackberry cassis bay leaf and brown spice prepare you for a mouth filling structured glass that shows supple mountain tannins serving to translate the aromas directly to palate flavors.  This wine is fabulous right now and will bring even greater rewards 10 years down the road.Vineyard Notes:The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allow the fruit to mature slowly in this Estate property allowing the development of incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <description>From one of our flagship vineyard sources this Rutherford Cabernet is both powerful and complex.&quot;The juggernaut that is V. Sattui Winery continues to roll out spectacular Cabernet Sauvignon from this vineyard.  The nose is extremely deep and complex with solid varietal character firm tannic structure lively acidity and a long finish that is currently emphasizing elegant red fruit and spice. This deserves five to ten years additional bottle aging to bring out all of its charms though they are already many.  A Platinum Award winner and Best of Class Cabernet Sauvignon at the 2015 Sommelier Challenge International Wine Competition.&quot;95 points Rich Cook Sep 15 2015</description>

        <title>2013 Black-sears Vineyard Zinfandel - Magnum</title>
        <description>This wine has impressive structure with firm gripping tannins and excellent acidity; benefits of Napa County's highest vineyard which is also biodynamically farmed and certified organic. What's best about this wine is the impeccable balance it shows off. This is a Zinfandel made in a style that is both restrained and loaded with flavor. The V. Sattui Black Sears Zinfandel is delicious today however those with patience will be rewarded. This wine is an ager to be sure. It'll improve over the next 5-8 years and drink well for at least 4-6 after that.Vineyard Notes:Black-Sears Vineyard is located in the Howell Mountain sub-appellation of Napa Valley. It was planted in 1975 and, at an elevation of 2400 ft., one of the highest vineyards in Napa County.  Soils are rocky and porous which allows for good drainage.  Black-Sears vineyard blooms later in the season due to the cooler climates on the mountain and so harvest is generally later in the fall.  The original vine cuttings came from the old Hayne Vineyard in St. Helena, one of the “Heritage Clones” of Zinfandel. The vines are head trained and the grapes are cultivated organically and bio-dynamically, requiring extra care and attention to bring to full maturity.  The vines are head trained they look like a big goblet.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2013 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:  Carsi Vineyard lies about thirteen miles south of the winery in a wide flat basin just north of the town of Napa. It's a cooler zone of heavier soils where Chardonnay does exceptionally well. V. Sattui purchased the land in 1989 and invested heavily in soil amendments fertilization and trellising of the existing vines before naming it after my great-grandfather Vittorio's Italian village in the mountains above Genoa. We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time.Winemaking Notes: Grapes are picked at night and delivered to the winery in half ton macro bins.  Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is settled for 24 hours at 50ºF, and then racked off the grape solids.  Specialty Chardonnay fermenting yeast is added to the must, and then it is transferred to barrels where it will start barrel fermentation.  Native fermentations will go to barrels without any yeast.  Once alcoholic fermentation is completed winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation.  All lots will be stirred biweekly through malolactic, and will stay on its lees until racked out for blending and bottling. 1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2013 Los Carneros Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Huichica Creek Vineyard (59%) is located in Los Carneros, Napa Valley AVA, close to the San Francisco Bay and it has VSP trellis with three clones of Chardonnay: UCD Clone 5, Dijon  Clone 95 and the “Old Wente” Clone, all on 101-14 rootstock. The Henry Ranch (41%) is also located in Los Carneros, Napa Valley AVA, but it at a higher elevation and farther away from the bay, along Carneros Creek and adjacent to the Mt Veeder AVA. It is planted to the Dijon selections 96 and 76 on 5C rootstock on a VSP trellis system, and the “Old Wente” clone on 101-14 rootstock on a modified “High V” trellis. The Dijon clones tend to be earlier ripening, with softer acidity while the UCD clone 5 has a bright acidity which provides good acid balance to the blend. The “Old Wente” clone has a distinct cluster shape and size, with smaller berries that are irregular in size and it is a lower yielding clone favored by winemakers for its intensity of aroma and flavor.Winemaking Notes:Grapes are picked at night and delivered to the winery in half ton macro bins.  They are loaded in the press whole cluster.  The juice is settled for 24 hours at 50ºF then racked.  Specialty Chardonnay fermenting yeast is added to the tank then transferred to barrels where it will be fermented.  Native, “indigenous yeast” fermentations (15-30% of total) are transferred to barrels without any added yeast.  Once the primary alcoholic fermentation is completed winemaking will determine which lots will go through a secondary, malolactic fermentation.  All lots are stirred biweekly in a process known as &quot;battonage&quot; to re-suspend the yeast.  All lots will stay on its lees &quot;sur-lie&quot; until lots are racked out for blending and bottling. 1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2013 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allow the fruit to mature slowly in this Estate property allowing the development of incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.One of our darkest cabernets with incredibly inky color it has ripe aromas of plum cherry fruit black olive and dried savory herbs in the nose. It is soft and very elegant on the palate with a round supple texture.  Cassis and black cherry fruit flavors linger on the finish.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <title>2013 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity.  The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.</description>

        <title>2013 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>94% Cabernet Sauvignon 4% Merlot 2% Petit Verdot  Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton Loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.  2013 was an unusually dry year. Spring only brought less than 5” of rain and the warm days set the stage for an ideal flowering and fruit set conditions. Temperatures were optimal for vine activity resulting in healthy vines as fruit went through veraison and grapes started maturing. August 1st was the start of harvest earliest recorded in recent history. White varietals came first followed by lighter reds. The warm temperatures throughout October allowed the later maturing varietals to hang and come to perfect phenolic ripeness. 2013 vintage was early and came in full rage two weeks early but the quality it delivered was exceptional.</description>

        <title>2014 Anderson Valley Pinot Noir - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: The Anderson Valley is located in the rolling hills of the coastal region of Mendocino County about two hours north of San Francisco. Only fifteen miles long half the length of Napa Valley this beautiful valley is home to a unique group of vineyards that produce a broad range of excellent wines including Burgundian varietals like Pinot Noir. The climate is significantly influenced by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the coolest AVAs in the state as well as getting about 40 inches of rain each year also more than most  wine regions.Boonville is our ranch in the Anderson Valley appellation it has the name of the town itself.  There are 11.6 acres divided into 5 small blocks each planted with different Pinot Noir clone or filed selection. Clone 115, 667 and 777 dark pigments and rich structure, and pure aromas, and the Calera selection comes from cuttings from a true Burgundian clone from Josh Jenson’s Mt Harlan Vineyard, as well as another selection from DRC which offer more seductive complexities.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2014 Black-sears Vineyard Zinfandel - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: 

Black-Sears Vineyard is located in the Howell Mountain
sub-appellation of Napa Valley. It was planted in 1975 and, at an elevation of
2400 ft., one of the highest vineyards in Napa County.  Soils are rocky and porous which allows for
good drainage.  Black-Sears vineyard
blooms later in the season due to the cooler climates on the mountain and so
harvest is generally later in the fall.  The
original vine cuttings came from the old Hayne Vineyard in St. Helena, one of
the “Heritage Clones” of Zinfandel. The vines are head trained and the grapes
are cultivated organically and bio-dynamically, requiring extra care and
attention to bring to full maturity.  The
vines are head trained they look like a big goblet. 1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2014 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Carsi Vineyard lies about thirteen miles south of the winery in a wide flat basin just north of the town of Napa. It's a cooler zone of heavier soils where Chardonnay does exceptionally well. V. Sattui purchased the land in 1989 and invested heavily in soil amendments fertilization and trellising of the existing vines before naming it after my great grandfather Vittorio's Italian village in the mountains above Genoa. We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time.Winemaking Notes:

Grapes are picked at night and delivered to the winery in
half ton macro bins.  Whole clusters are pressed
and the juice is settled for 24 hours at 50ºF, and then racked off the grape solids.  Specialty Chardonnay fermenting yeast is
added to the must, and then it is transferred to barrels where it will start
barrel fermentation.  Native
fermentations will go to barrels without any yeast.  Once alcoholic fermentation is completed
winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic
fermentation.  All lots will be stirred biweekly
through malolactic, and will stay on its lees until racked out for blending and
bottling. 1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2014 Los Carneros Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Carneros has been called the Burgundy of California because the two Burgundian grape varieties Chardonnay and Pinot Noir achieve exquisite flavors in this region.Winemaking Notes:Grapes are picked at night and delivered to the winery in half ton macro bins.  They are loaded in the press whole cluster.  The juice is settled for 24 hours at 50F then racked.  Specialty Chardonnay fermenting yeast is added to the tank then transferred to barrels where it will be fermented.  Native fermentations will be transferred to barrels without any yeast.  Once alcoholic fermentation is completed winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation.  All lots will be stirred biweekly.  All wine will stay on its lees until lots are racked out for blending and bottling. 1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2014 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>From the famed Rutherford Bench this wine always delivers with elegance and finesse.This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli's Vineyard located in the heart of the famed &quot;Rutherford Bench&quot;. Gary is a third-generation farmer on this property a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained gravelly soils which produce fine-grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a &quot;V-trellis&quot; that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grapes to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993.</description>

        <title>2014 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allow the fruit to mature slowly in this Estate property allowing the development of incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.One of our darkest cabernets with incredibly inky color it has ripe aromas of plum cherry fruit black olive and dried savory herbs in the nose. It is soft and very elegant on the palate with a round supple texture.  Cassis and black cherry fruit flavors linger on the finish.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2014 Regina</title>
        <description>Winemaking Notes:These grapes are picked late in the fall season at night in ½ ton bins arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled the clear juice is then racked into 100% new French Oak barrels where they are inoculated with yeast strain SL3. This is a special yeast strain ideal for fermentations with varietals that are exceptionally aromatic to preserve these fruit forward characteristics. When fermentation is complete a significant amount natural sugar is still present in the wine but over its two-year aging process begins transform its flavor and intensity.</description>

        <title>2015 Anderson Valley Pinot Noir - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: The Anderson Valley is located in the rolling hills of the coastal region of Mendocino County about two hours north of San Francisco. Only fifteen miles long half the length of Napa Valley this beautiful valley is home to a unique group of vineyards that produce a broad range of excellent wines including Burgundian varietals like Pinot Noir. The climate is significantly influenced by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the coolest AVAs in the state as well as getting about 40 inches of rain each year also more than most wine regions.Boonville is our ranch in the Anderson Valley appellation it has the name of the town itself.  There are 11.6 acres divided into 5 small blocks each planted with different Pinot Noir clone or filed selection. Clone 115, 667 and 777 dark pigments and rich structure, and pure aromas, and the Calera selection comes from cuttings from a true Burgundian clone form Josh Jenson’s Mt Harlan Vineyard, as well as another selection from DRC which offer more seductive complexities.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

Sattui purchased the land in 1989 and invested heavily in soil amendments fertilization and trellising of the existing vines before naming it after my great-grandfather Vittorio's Italian village in the mountains above Genoa. We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time.Winemaking Notes: Grapes are picked at night and delivered to the winery in half ton macro bins.  Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is settled for 24 hours at 50ºF, and then racked off the grape solids.  Specialty Chardonnay fermenting yeast is added to the must, and then it is transferred to barrels where it will start barrel fermentation.  Native fermentations will go to barrels without any yeast.  Once alcoholic fermentation is completed winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation.  All lots will be stirred biweekly through malolactic, and will stay on its lees until racked out for blending and bottling. 1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2015 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench”. Gary is a third-generation farmer on this property a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained gravelly soils which produce fine-grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grapes to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993. &quot;This red is pointed in the right direction with a mix of supple spicy dark berry currant plum and cedary oak flavors. Very complete. Best from 2020 through 2030.&quot; - W.S.(Limit: 6 per person)</description>

        <title>2015 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allows the fruit to mature slowly in the Estate property developing incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.</description>

        <title>2015 Preston Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>The Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity.  The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.</description>

        <title>2015 Vintage Port</title>
        <description>Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel tank where peak temperature is typically 92ºF and the yeast strain is Premier Cuvee.Before all the sugar has been converted to alcohol, a neutral grape brandy is added to the wine; this process is known as fortification. The addition of brandy to the wine halts fermentation by inhibiting the yeast from converting sugar to alcohol. The resulting wine retains some of its residual sugar with an alcohol that is typically around 18% alcohol by volume (abv). The wine is then racked from stainless steel tank to seasoned French oak barrels where they will age and be topped bi-annually.</description>

        <title>2015 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>&quot;A testament to what happens when great fruit and great winemaking practice come together.  Brooks Painter’s team seems to never miss with this vineyard with this vintage showing a complex mix of red and black fruit fall spice pleasantly chalky tannins and bright acidity that gives the finish a big push.  Elegant and refined.  A Platinum Award Winner at the 2018 Critics Challenge International Wine &amp; Spirits Competition.&quot;  -96 Points Rich Cook May 26th 2018  Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton Loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2016 Anderson Valley Pinot Noir - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: The Anderson Valley is located in the rolling hills of the coastal region of Mendocino County about two hours north of San Francisco. Only fifteen miles long half the length of Napa Valley this beautiful valley is home to a unique group of vineyards that produce a broad range of excellent wines including Burgundian varietals like Pinot Noir.  The climate is significantly influenced by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the coolest AVAs in the state as well as getting about 40 inches of rain each year also more than most wine regions.We source grapes for our Anderson Valley Pinot Noir from our very own estate ranch in Boonville. We have 11.6 acres divided into 5 small blocks, each of which are planted with different Pinot Noir clones or field selection. Clone 115, 667 and 777 dark pigments and rich structure, and pure aromas, and the Calera selection comes from cuttings from a true Burgundian clone form Josh Jenson’s Mt Harlan Vineyard, as well as another selection from DRC which offer more seductive complexities.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel tank where peak temperature is typically 92ºF; and the yeast strain is RC212. The wine is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the skins and seeds.For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin content. Once these are at an optimum in the wine we drain the free-run juice from the skins to another tank and keep separate the hard press wine, which will be evaluated and aged separately. Once the new wine has settled in tank (3-4 days) we rack off the gross grape solids (lees) and move to barrels. The 2nd fermentation (called Malolactic) will then proceed in small barrels over several months.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2016 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Carsi Vineyard lies about thirteen miles south of the winery in a wide flat basin just north of the town of Napa.  It's a cooler zone of heavier soils where Chardonnay does exceptionally well. V. Sattui purchased the land in 1989 and invested heavily in soil amendments fertilization and trellising of the existing vines before naming it after my great-grandfather Vittorio's Italian village in the mountains above Genoa.  We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time. Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into 100% new French oak barrels for fermentation. We typically divide the Chardonnay from this vineyard into four different lots; three of them will be inoculated with a different yeast strain; each one capable of producing different aromatic compounds while one lot will undergo a native fermentation with no yeast addition. Once primary fermentation has been completed, winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation, also referred to as secondary fermentation. The completion of malolactic fermentation will aid in providing a creamier texture with a fuller mouthfeel. All lots are stirred biweekly through malolactic, and will age on its lees for ten months until racked out for blending and bottling.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2016 Los Carneros Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our Los Carneros Chardonnay is an exquisite compilation of select vineyards throughout the AVA, each site bringing a certain nuance to the finalized blend. The cool climate in Carneros makes it ideal for growing Chardonnay grapes, and this wine is here to prove it. The grapes come from our own historic Hibbard Ranch property, as well as renowned Chardonnay source, Huichica Vineyard, also in Los Carneros.Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF.

        <title>2016 Los Carneros Pinot Noir - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2016 Los Carneros Pinot Noir is a glorious representation of this world renowned viticultural area. The fruit for this wine comes from our estate vineyard, Henry Ranch, located along Carneros Creek and adjacent to the Mt. Veeder AVA. It is planted to four different clones, Dijon selections 115 and 777, clone 828 and Pommard clone 5, all grafted to 44-53 rootstocks on a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system. The VSP trellis forces clusters to the outside of the canopy, to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions. Summer average temperatures range from 50 to 90 F which makes it ideal site for these varietals. Cool summer nights retain the acidity and hot days bring the maturity to perfection.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF.

        <title>2016 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench”. Gary is a third-generation farmer on this property a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained gravelly soils which produce fine-grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grapes to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <description>This expressive mountain gem weaves a seamless story of flavors and aromas that will continue to develop new chapters for years to come. Cellar with confidence or pair now with slow-braised beef short ribs on a bed of polenta or creamy mashed potatoes for a memorable meal.Vineyard Notes:Located in the rugged Mayacamas Mountains at elevations ranging from 1250-1400 ft. our Mt. Veeder Estate is situated in a unique microclimate offering cooler temperatures during the day with warmer temperatures at night. Planted on ancient marine soils the fruit in this vineyard develops slowly and steadily until full phenolic ripeness is reached. Often the very last of our vineyards to be harvested; our Mt. Veeder Estate offers small yields of deeply pigmented intensely flavored fruit which produce wines of complexity power and elegance that speak to their provenance year after year.(Limit: 3 per person)</description>

        <title>2016 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>Located in the rugged Mayacamas Mountains at elevations ranging from 1250-1400 ft. our Mt. Veeder Estate is situated in a unique microclimate offering cooler temperatures during the day with warmer temperatures at night. Planted on ancient marine soils the fruit in this vineyard develops slowly and steadily until full phenolic ripeness is reached. Often the very last of our vineyards to be harvested; our Mt. Veeder Estate offers small yields of deeply pigmented intensely flavored fruit which produce wines of complexity power and elegance that speak to their provenance year after year.</description>

        <title>2016 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allows the fruit to mature slowly in the Estate property developing incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.</description>

        <title>2016 Paradiso - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>This beautiful Bordeaux blend uses all five of the classic Bordeaux grape varieties bringing the flavors and characters of the individual grapes into a fabulous expression of cellar-worthy Cabernet Sauvignon wine. It is loaded with black cherry aromas black pepper spice and rich blackcurrant and jammy notes and tannin structure from the Cabernet. The red berry fruit and round ripe plum and cocoa from the Merlot are joined with the assertive earthy tones of Malbec minerals and graphite/pencil lead and cedar from Petite Verdot and savory aromatic herbs and hazelnut from the Cabernet Franc. Together they make a truly remarkable and unique red blend worthy of the best Napa Valley has to offer.Vintage Notes: Following the very small 2015 harvest it was heartening to see the vines recover and bounce back to produce not only extremely high quality fruit but also some bounty in 2016! Harvest was earlier than we expected and we observed optimum flavor and phenolic development progress as we harvested. With the ample rain that fell this past spring the soils were moist and the vines started growing in early spring and shoot growth was active. Flowering also turned out be optimum with very little frost so the individual grape varieties responded and good pollination allowed for a more typical crop.  Across the board the flavors and acids were exceptional; very fresh fruit aromas and flavors were evident in the whites and a delicious balance evolved as the harvest proceeded. Acids are firm and pH is slightly lower so the wines should be well-structured with very good aging potential. During harvest we saw the reds evolve every day as the skins softened the tannins became more velvety and the grapes came into their own. This is an exciting vintage with a lot to like!</description>

        <description>Following the very small 2015 harvest it was heartening to see the vines recover and bounce back to produce not only extremely high quality fruit but also some bounty in 2016!Vineyard Notes:The Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity.  The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest. (Limit: 6 per person)</description>

        <title>2016 Select Late Harvest Riesling Anderson Valley</title>
        <description>Though it is packaged in a small bottle this wine packs a big punch! (375 mL bottle) Vineyard Notes:Our 2016 Late Harvest Riesling sources fruit grown at our estate vineyard in Anderson Valley surrounded on three sides by rolling hills and low mountains and open to the west through majestic old- and second-growth redwoods to the Pacific Ocean along the Navarro River. With the coastal influence keeping temperatures cool grapes are allowed to develop slowly ripen evenly and develop their characteristically exotic flavors over time while preserving acidity. This vineyard is planted utilizing a VSP trellis system which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy to increases their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.The grapes were fully infected with the noble rot (botrytis cinerea) a fungus which naturally increases sugars. Depending on the conditions botrytis can be either beneficial or devastating to grapes. In its benevolent form over a period of cool mornings and warm afternoons the grapes shrivel concentrating and intensifying both sugar and flavor. The grape's acid level remains high however which prevents the resulting wines from being cloyingly sweet.</description>

        <title>2016 Vangone Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vangone Vineyards adjacent to Rector Reservoir and tucked in the hills between Atlas Peak and Oakville with elevation from 900 feet to 1500 feet above the valley floor is a new vineyard (established in 2012) that spent little time hesitating before it spread its wings and produced amazingly balanced and complex fruit. Just below the Stagecoach property and across from Dalle Valle lies 103 acres of which approximately 15 acres are planted of volcanic type soils and several micro-climates that provide the ultimate conditions for growing the high quality Bordeaux varietals of Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Franc and a small amount of Petit Verdot. A variety of clones and rootstocks were carefully selected to create the best possible outcome from their location in the vineyard. The fruit is typically dark in color with a deep powerful profile laced with hints of earth and high-toned structure.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <title>2016 Vin Santo Monastero Di Coriano</title>
        <description>Winemaking Notes:After harvest, Malvasia del Chianti and Trebbiano Toscano grapes are brought to a well-ventilated and protected room where they are laid out on mats to dry for many months in a process referred to as “passito.”These grapes are harvested before they overripen to retain acidity which helps to balance out the sweetness of the final product. The ensuing desiccation results in concentrated sugars and once they have reached their desired sugar level they are pressed. The must is then placed into small barrels made of chestnut and cherry wood where a slow fermentation and long maturation takes place. As the rooms increase in temperature during the spring the Vin Santo fermentation begins It is a long and slow fermentation that can rise and fall with the seasons and can take up to four years to complete.(Limit: 3 per person)</description>

        <title>2016 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton Loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.</description>

        <title>2016 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton Loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.</description>

        <title>2017 Anderson Valley Pinot Noir - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: The Anderson Valley is located in the rolling hills of the coastal region of Mendocino County about two hours north of San Francisco. Only fifteen miles long half the length of Napa Valley this beautiful valley is home to a unique group of vineyards that produce a broad range of excellent wines including Burgundian varietals like Pinot Noir.  The climate is significantly influenced by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the coolest AVAs in the state as well as getting about 40 inches of rain each year also more than most wine regions.We source grapes for our Anderson Valley Pinot Noir from our very own estate ranch in Boonville. We have 11.6 acres divided into 5 small blocks, each of which are planted with different Pinot Noir clones or field selection. Clone 115, 667 and 777 dark pigments and rich structure, and pure aromas, and the Calera selection comes from cuttings from a true Burgundian clone form Josh Jenson’s Mt Harlan Vineyard, as well as another selection from DRC which offer more seductive complexities.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2017 Blanc De Noir</title>
        <description>Each sip is delightfully balanced with a refreshing acidity and a hint of natural sweetness accompanied by its subtle creamy texture and effervescence.Vineyard Notes: Our 2017 Blanc de Noir is made from 100% Pinot Noir grapes that were grown from our Estate Vineyard “Boonville Ranch” in Anderson Valley Mendocino County. This appellation is ideal for producing high quality sparkling wines because of it’s proximately to the Pacific Ocean. The cool coastal climate allows the grapes to ripen slowly and retain their acidity levels an essential quality needed for sparkling wines.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are hand-harvested at night into ½ ton bins arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the “free run juice” is separated from the “press juice”. The juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks. After primary fermentation the resulting wine is “bone dry” (no residual grape sugar) then the “Tirage” bottling occurs where it undergoes the secondary fermentation in the bottle following the French “Méthode Champenoise”. Following the aging process bottles are transferred into riddling bins where they undergo a month long process of slight turns which gradually move the yeast lees to the cork. Once completed the bottles undergo the disgorging process where they are inverted the necks frozen to ensure the sediment is removed and then finished with the cork and packaging.At this point the champagne is ready to be enjoyed!</description>

        <title>2017 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Carsi Vineyard lies about thirteen miles south of the winery in a wide flat basin just north of the town of Napa. It's a cooler zone of heavier soils where Chardonnay does exceptionally well. V. Sattui purchased the land in 1989 and invested heavily in soil amendments fertilization and trellising of the existing vines before naming it after my great-grandfather Vittorio's Italian village in the mountains above Genoa. We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time.Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into 100% French oak barrels for fermentation. We typically divide the Chardonnay from this vineyard into four different lots; three of them will be inoculated with a different yeast strain; each one capable of producing different aromatic compounds while one lot will undergo a native fermentation with no yeast addition. Once primary fermentation has been completed, winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation, also referred to as secondary fermentation. The completion of malolactic fermentation will aid in providing a creamier texture with a fuller mouthfeel. All lots are stirred biweekly through malolactic and will age on its lees for ten months until racked out for blending and bottling.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2017 Los Carneros Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Our 2017 Los Carneros Chardonnay was crafted with fruit from our estate vineyard, Hibbard Ranch in Los Carneros. This cool appellation overlooks the San Pablo Bay, where summer average temperatures range from 50º to 90ºF, making it an ideal site for Burgundian varietals. The cool summer nights allow the fruit to retain its acidity while warmer days bring the maturity to perfection. These vines are farmed utilizing a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system, which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold.

        <title>2017 Los Carneros Pinot Noir - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2017 Los Carneros Pinot Noir is a glorious representation of this world renowned viticultural area. The fruit for this wine comes from our estate vineyard, Henry Ranch, located along Carneros Creek and adjacent to the Mt. Veeder AVA. It is planted to four different clones, Dijon selections 115 and 777, clone 828 and Pommard clone 5, all grafted to 44-53 rootstocks on a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system. The VSP trellis forces clusters to the outside of the canopy, to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions. Summer average temperatures range from 50º to 90ºF which makes it ideal site for these varietals. Cool summer nights retain the acidity and hot days bring the maturity to perfection.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel tank where peak temperature is typically 92ºF; and the yeast strain is RC212. The wine is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the skins and seeds.For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin content. Once these are at an optimum in the wine we drain the free-run juice from the skins to another tank and keep separate the hard press wine, which will be evaluated and aged separately. Once the new wine has settled in tank (3-4 days) we rack off the gross grape solids (lees) and move to barrels. The 2nd fermentation (called Malolactic) will then proceed in small barrels over several months.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2017 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench” below Mt. St. John in the Mayacamas range. Gary is a third-generation farmer in a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained Bale Clay Loam gravelly soils producing fine- grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2017 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>The 2017 wine quality shows a lot of bright acidity and fresh varietal aromas in the white wines and deep color sweet fruit flavors and firm tannin structure in the reds. Yields were good with a few varieties being a bit above average and some below historical production. Vineyard Notes:Located in the rugged Mayacamas Mountains at elevations ranging from 1250-1400 ft. our Mt. Veeder Estate is situated in a unique microclimate offering cooler temperatures during the day with warmer temperatures at night. Planted on ancient marine soils the fruit in this vineyard develops slowly and steadily until full phenolic ripeness is reached. Often the very last of our vineyards to be harvested; our Mt. Veeder Estate offers small yields of deeply pigmented intensely flavored fruit which produce wines of complexity power and elegance that speak to their provenance year after year.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <title>2017 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather, who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’, and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained, gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity, and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.</description>

We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time.Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into 100% new French oak barrels for fermentation. We typically divide the Chardonnay from this vineyard into four different lots; three of them will be inoculated with a different yeast strain; each one capable of producing different aromatic compounds while one lot will undergo a native fermentation with no yeast addition. Once primary fermentation has been completed, winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation, also referred to as secondary fermentation. The completion of malolactic fermentation will aid in providing a creamier texture with a fuller mouthfeel. All lots are stirred biweekly through malolactic, and will age on its lees for ten months until racked out for blending and bottling.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2018 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench” below Mt. St. John in the Mayacamas range. Gary is a third-generation farmer in a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained Bale Clay Loam gravelly soils producing fine- grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-west by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993. </description>

        <title>2018 Prestige Cuvée Brut Rosé</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:For our Prestige Cuvée Brut Rosé we used a blend of 84% Pinot Noir and 16% Chardonnay from grapes grown from our estate vineyards along the North Coast. This appellation is the perfect climate for producing high quality sparkling wines because of the cooling influence of the Pacific Ocean. The moderate, coastal climate allows the grapes to ripen slowly and retain their acidity levels, an essential quality needed for sparkling wines.Winemaking Notes: The grapes are hand- harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the “free run juice” is separated from the “press juice”. The juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks. After primary fermentation the resulting wine is “bone dry” (no residual grape sugar), then the “Tirage” bottling occurs, where it undergoes the secondary fermentation in the bottle following the French “Method Champenoise”. Following the aging process, bottles are transferred into riddling bins where they undergo a month-long process of slight turns which gradually move the yeast lees to the cork. Once completed, the bottles undergo the disgorging process where they are inverted, the necks frozen to ensure the sediment is removed and then finished with the cork and packaging. At this point, the champagne is ready to be enjoyed!</description>

        <title>2018 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity. The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.</description>

        <title>2018 Vangone Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Vangone Vineyard is located on the bench land above a steep cliff on the east side of the Napa Valley, 1200 feet above the valley floor. This unique vineyard site features gravelly, volcanic soils and a southwestern facing sun exposure. To match site and soil conditions, Cabernet clones 191m 4 and 169 were densely planted on 6’ x 4’ spacing to ensure ideal terroir for top quality Mountain Cabernet.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel, with a small amount in 60 gallon barrels for “barrel-fermentation”; tank peak temperature is typically 92ºF; and the yeast strain is Premier Cuvee. The wine is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the skins and seeds.For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin content. Once these are at an optimum in the wine we drain the free-run juice from the skins to another tank and keep separate the hard press wine, which will be evaluated and aged separately. Once the new wine has settled in tank (3-4 days) we rack off the gross grape solids (lees) and move to barrels. The 2nd fermentation (called Malolactic) will then proceed in small barrels over several months.</description>

        <title>2018 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.</description>

        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Collins Family Block 20 Zinfandel was planted in 1923 on an alluvial fan on the north end of the St. Helena Appellation and is adjacent to the Historic Bale Gristmill. The traditional head-trained vines are grafted to St. George rootstock and this years’ harvest marks the vines 96th birthday! The yields average less than 3 tons per acre and the soil is very well-drained with lots of large stones and gravel that has been washed down from the steep Mayacamas Mountain Range to the West. </description>

        <title>2019 Dry Creek Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Dry Creek Valley in Sonoma County is recognized as one of the top growing regions for Zinfandel in California.  The hot summer days produce fruit flavors that are fully developed and complex while the proximity to the Pacific Ocean fog provides for rapid cooling in the evening which maintains excellent acid balance in the grapes and wine. </description>

        <title>2019 Gilsson Vineyard Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Gilsson Vineyard is located along the Eastern section of the Russian River Valley Appellation in Sonoma County. The vines were planted in the early 1960s to St. George rootstock and are head-trained and spur-pruned. The soils consist of old weathered “Laughlin Series” clay loam. The nutrients from these soils are tightly bound to microscopic clay particles and thus are not readily available which make the vines work harder for survival. This struggle translates to a lower fruit production per vine but higher quality grapes with concentrated flavors.Fingers of Pacific fog follow the Russian River inland cooling its watershed ahead of the surrounding terrain and making the area markedly cooler. This appellation already well-revered for its Pinot Noirs has been very consistent with producing well-bred and extracted Zinfandels as well most notably DeLoach, J. Rochioli and Hartford among others. Gilsson Vineyard actually is in an area where two appellations intersect Russian River and Chalk Hill so the vineyard experiences not only cooling fog but chalky soil as well the best of both.</description>

        <title>2019 Katarina Pinot Noir</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2019 Katarina Pinot Noir sources grapes from our estate vineyard in the Russian River Valley. This AVA is strongly influenced by two key factors; weather and geology. The coastal influence from the Pacific Ocean moderates the temperatures as much as 35 to 40 degrees from its daytime high. This climate promotes full flavor maturity over an extended growing season while allowing the fruit to retain its natural acidity. The combination of fractured sandstone and sandy loam soils allow the vineyards to retain water and heat which help to produce smooth round wines with less acidity that are highly aromatic.</description>

        <description>This classic Italian red wine is made from the Sangiovese grape variety the mainstay of the Tuscan grapes that are grown in the rugged hills of Italy's famed Chianti Region in Italy. Monastero Le Vallesi a monastery built by Augustinian monks prior to the year 1000 on a hillside near Siena in the Chianti area of Tuscany is now owned by Dario Sattui proprietor of V. Sattui Winery. He is restoring the property and making small lots of wine and olive oil that are only sold at V. Sattui Winery.  </description>

        <title>2019 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench” below Mt. St. John in the Mayacamas range. Gary is a third-generation farmer in a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained Bale Clay Loam gravelly soils producing fine- grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-west by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993. Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel, with a small amount in 60-gallon barrels for “barrel-fermentation”; tank peak temperature is typically 92ºF; and the yeast strain is Premier Cuvee. The wine is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the skins and seeds.For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin content. Once these are at an optimum in the wine, we drain the free-run juice from the skins to another tank and keep separate the hard press wine, which will be evaluated and aged separately. Once the new wine has settled in tank (3-4 days) we rack off the gross grape solids (lees) and move to barrels. The 2nd fermentation (called Malolactic) will then proceed in small barrels over several months.</description>

        <description>Mounts Vineyard has been a source of premium wine grapes for three generations in the Dry Creek Valley. With experience gained from over 50 years of farming the same ground the Mounts Family uses this knowledge of each block’s unique exposure soil texture and depth when choosing rootstock clone and trellis design. This careful consideration allows for excellent vine balance giving the maximum expression of fruit character balance and structure to the Mounts Vineyard Zinfandel.</description>

        <title>2019 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The rugged mountain elevations have complex marine Franciscan Formation soils with metamorphosed marine sediments such as Haire loam Cole silt loam Fagan clay loam and Felton gravelly loam with small amounts of more recent Sonoma Volcanic soils. The cool Mt. Veeder appellation overlooking the San Pablo Bay allows the fruit to mature slowly developing incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time of the grapes. We have Cabernet clones 4 7 337 and 191 planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock. The vines are spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.

        <title>2019 Napa Valley Grenache</title>
        <description>The components of our 2019 Napa Valley Grenache are sourced completely from our own estate ranches: Carsi Vineyard in Yountville and Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena. We use two different clones of Grenache Alban and 362 which are planted on steep hills and grafted to rootstocks 1103-P and 101-14. While this wine is made of predominantly Grenache we sought to blend in just a touch of Syrah and Alicante Bouschet which aid in providing some dark fruit and slightly peppery characteristics. All of our vines are spaced at 7ft. between the rows and 4ft. between the vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a v. vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.</description>

        <title>2019 Napa Valley Petite Sirah</title>
        <description>There is no doubt that our 2019 Petite Sirah is here to make a statement. It is bursting with ripe fruit character reflective of the grapes that were sourced from some of our favorite vineyards: Oles Vineyard in St. Helena AVA and Allias Vineyard located in Rutherford and Mounts Vineyard over in Dry Creek Valley. Though these vineyards are found in different viticultural regions they are all optimally located near coastal mountain ranges which serve as a conduit for the cool costal air and fog to come in at night. While long warm days allow for the fruit to fully ripen the evenings allow grapes to mature slowly and retain the perfect acidity and balance.Vintage</description>

        <title>2019 Paradiso</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Paradiso is the proprietary name for our red “Meritage” - a Bordeaux-style blend that changes in varietal composition from vintage to vintage. In an homage to this type of wine, we have included five of classic grape varietals, with no single variety making up more than 90% of the blend. The beauty of this is that no one varietal stands out, but that each one is harmoniously balanced by the others. These wines are prized for the smooth, silky textures and complex, full-bodied structure. They age beautifully for decades; however, most are also very drinkable in their younger years.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF.

        <title>2019 Reserve Stock Napa Valley Chardonnay</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2019 Reserve Napa Valley Chardonnay is a beautifully balanced blend, crafted using fruit from our estate properties Hibbard Ranch (53%) in Los Carneros and Carsi Vineyard (47%) in Yountville. These properties are located toward the cool, southern end of Napa Valley where fog from the San Pablo Bay helps to regulate temperature throughout the growing season. The coastal influence of the bay keeps daytime temperatures cool, allowing grapes to develop slowly, ripen evenly, and develop full varietal flavors over time while preserving acidity.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into 100% new French oak barrels for fermentation. We typically divide the Chardonnay into four different lots; three of them will be inoculated with a different yeast strain; each one capable of producing different aromatic compounds, while one lot will undergo a native fermentation with no yeast addition. Once primary fermentation has been completed, winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation, also referred to as secondary fermentation. The completion of malolactic fermentation will aid in providing a creamier texture with a fuller mouthfeel. All lots are stirred biweekly through malolactic and will age on its lees for nine months until racked out for blending and bottling.</description>

        <title>2019 Reserve Stock Pinot Noir</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:For our 2019 Reserve Stock Pinot Noir we created a blend that sourced fruit from our estate vineyards Hibbard Ranch located in Los Carneros, Napa Valley and Collina d’ Oro Vineyard, nestled along the Russian River in Sonoma County. Both appellations are in close proximity to marine climates, allowing the morning fog to inhibit significant temperature rises in the morning. With the coastal influence keeping temperatures cool, and chance of late-season rain minimal, the grapes are allowed to develop slowly, ripen evenly, and develop fruit flavors over time while preserving acidity.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel tank where peak temperature is typically 92ºF; and the yeast strain is RC212. The wine is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the skins and seeds.For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin content. Once these are at an optimum in the wine, we drain the free-run juice from the skins to another tank and keep separate the hard press wine, which will be evaluated and aged separately. Once the new wine has settled in tank (3-4 days) we rack off the gross grape solids (lees) and move to barrels. The 2nd fermentation (called Malolactic) will then proceed in small barrels over several months.</description>

        <title>2019 Rutherford Dust Up Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This very limited and special bottling of Cabernet Sauvignon comes from a blend of Gary Morisoli’s vineyard on Niebaum Lane and his brother, Mike Morisoli’s vineyard, just a stone’s throw away. Mike and Gary are 3rd generation Napa Valley grape growers, beginning with the Morisoli Family planted grapes in western Rutherford in early 1950’s. The vineyards are located in the heart of the famous “Rutherford Bench”, an area of well-drained, alluvial soils below Mt. St. John that produce fine grain “dusty” and supple tannins and where some of the most notable Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. It is a tribute to their family’s hard work and dedication to growing the finest grapes in Napa Valley.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel, with a small amount in 60-gallon barrels for “barrel-fermentation”; tank peak temperature is typically 92ºF; and the yeast strain is Premier Cuvee. The wine is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the skins and seeds.For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin content.

        <title>2019 Vittorio's Vineyard Petit Verdot</title>
        <description>Vineyards Notes:Our Petit Verdot grapes are grown on property at
our St. Helena estate, Vittorio’s Vineyard. This property was named in honor of Dario
Sattui’s great-grandfather, who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San
Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. 
Its Pleasanton loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient
stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of
years.  The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’,
and rows are slightly North of East-West and grown to a VSP trellis system,
which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy to increase their exposure
to sunlight and enhance the ripening. Winemaking Notes:The
grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early
morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank.
The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF.
Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel tank where a peak temperature
is typically 92ºF; and the yeast strain is Premier Cuvee. The wine
is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the
skins and seeds. 



For
this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity,
complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin
content. Once these are at an optimum in the wine we drain the free-run juice

        <title>2020 Cara Chardonnay</title>
        <description>&quot;With this special bottling of Chardonnay I dedicate this wine to my wife Cara.  Like Katarina before her Cara is a very strong forthright determined and loving woman. Cara and I met as co-workers here at V. Sattui Winery 41 years ago and two years later we were married!  I marvel and celebrate strong women that balance family work and community and that is the inspiration behind the naming of this wine!&quot; - V. Sattui Winery President Tom DaviesVineyard Notes:Our 2020 Cara Chardonnay is a unique blend of fruit sourced from our estate properties Hibbard Ranch (32%) in Los Carneros and Carsi Vineyard (68%) in Yountville. These properties are located toward the cool southern end of Napa Valley where fog from the San Pablo Bay helps regulate temperature throughout the growing season. The coastal influence of the bay keeps daytime temperatures cool allowing grapes to develop slowly ripen evenly and develop full varietal flavors.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into 100% French oak barrels for fermentation. We typically divide the Chardonnay juice into four different lots; three of them will be inoculated with a different yeast strain; each one capable of producing different aromatic compounds while one lot will undergo a native fermentation with no yeast addition. Once primary fermentation has been completed, winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation, also referred to as secondary fermentation. The completion of malolactic fermentation will aid in providing a creamier texture with a fuller mouthfeel. All lots are stirred biweekly through malolactic and will age on its lees for nine months until racked out for blending and bottling.</description>

        <title>2020 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay sources fruit solely from our estate vineyard located in Yountville. It is a 27-acre vineyard named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace the Italian hillside village of Carsi.  Yountville has a combination of soil types and microclimates that make this location perfect for growing different varietals. There are three Chardonnay blocks each planted to showcase a unique clone of Chardonnay. Clones 95 and 76 are Dijon clones which are lower yielding with small clusters and concentrated flavors while clone 809 characteristically has a more floral aroma. These Chardonnay vines were planted in 1999 on a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions. Summer average temperatures range from 50 to 90 F which makes it ideal site for these varietals.  Cool summer nights retain the acidity and hot days bring the maturity to perfection.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, 43and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50F.

        <title>2020 Collina D'oro Chardonnay</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our Estate vineyard Collina d'Oro rests in the Russian River Valley within Sonoma County. This site is perfectly suited for Chardonnay due to the coastal fog influence and the &quot;Gold Ridge&quot; sandy loam soils. The vineyard gets its name from these soils which means &quot;Hills of Gold&quot; in Italian.  The Russian River Valley is strongly influenced by two key factors; weather and geology. The coastal influence from the Pacific Ocean moderates the temperatures as much as 35 to 40 degrees from its daytime high. This climate promotes full flavor maturity over an extended growing season while allowing the fruit to retain its natural acidity. The combination of fractured sandstone and sandy loam soils allow the vineyards to retain water and heat which help to produce smooth round wines with less acidity that are highly aromatic. Winemaking Notes:We typically divide the Chardonnay juice into four different lots; three of them will be inoculated with a different yeast strain; each one capable of producing different aromatic compounds while one lot will undergo a native fermentation with no yeast addition. Once primary fermentation has been completed winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation also referred to as secondary fermentation.

        <title>2020 Entanglement (gsm)</title>
        <description>Vineyards Notes: Our Entanglement is a delightful blend featuring Grenache, Syrah and Mourvédre (GSM). Our Grenache and Syrah are sourced from our Carsi Vineyard estate located in Yountville. This 27-acre vineyard was named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace, the Italian hillside village of Carsi. Yountville has a combination of soil types and micro climates that make this location perfect for growing different varietals. Our Mourvédre comes from Vittorio’s Vineyard located at our estate in St Helena, where only half an acre is planted. Last, but certainly not least we incorporate a touch of our Petite Sirah, which adds a dash of its characteristic rich, purple color, and recognizably deep fruity flavor.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel tank where a peak temperature is typically 92ºF; and the yeast strain is Premier Cuvee. The wine is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the skins and seeds.For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin content. Once these are at an optimum in the wine we drain the free-run juice from the skins to another tank and keep separate the hard press wine, which will be evaluated and aged separately. Once the new wine has settled in tank (3-4 days) we rack off the gross grape solids (lees) and move to barrels. The 2nd fermentation (called Malolactic) will then proceed in small barrels over several months.</description>

        <title>2020 Gilsson Vineyard Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Gilsson
Vineyard is located along the Eastern section of the Russian River Valley
Appellation in Sonoma County. The vines were planted in the early 1960s to St.
George rootstock and are head-trained and spur-pruned. The soils consist of
old, weathered “Laughlin Series” clay loam. The nutrients from these soils are
tightly bound to microscopic clay particles and thus are not readily available
which make the vines work harder for survival. This struggle translates to a
lower fruit production per vine, but higher quality grapes with concentrated
flavors. Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving
at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted
and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is
3-4 days at 50 F. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel tank where a
peak temperature is typically 92 0F; and the yeast strain is Premier
Cuvee. The wine is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin
extraction from the skins and seeds.



For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep
red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and
overall tannin content. Once these are at an optimum in the wine we drain the
free-run juice from the skins to another tank and keep separate the hard press
wine, which will be evaluated and aged separately. Once the new wine has
settled in tank (3-4 days) we rack off the gross grape solids (lees) and move
to barrels. The 2nd fermentation (called Malolactic) will then
proceed in small barrels over several months.</description>

        <title>2020 La Merica</title>
        <description>About La Merica: Our 2020 La Merica celebrates and honors our winery’s Italian heritage with a modern interpretation of a classic pre-prohibition blend. Though proprietary by nature this wine is largely composed from grape varietals sourced from our estate vineyards Carsi Vineyard and Hibbard Ranch. The star players in this powerhouse blend are some of the key Rhone varietals like Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Grenache along with a few unlikely candidates mixed in to spice things up!“I wanted to make a wine that celebrated and honored our winery’s Italian heritage with a modern interpretation of a classic pre-prohibition blend.   For over 150 years in California Petite Sirah and Zinfandel have been planted side-by-side and are natural blending partners – with Petite Sirah providing the color spice and structure and Zinfandel contributing its varietal distinctive dark berry fruit and aromas.  Our new-world blend takes these classic grapes and steers away from the rustic old-world style and boldly produces a wine filled with deeply dark-fruited flavors inky-purple color and supple and lingering textures.In searching for name for this special wine I came across a paper given to me by Dr. Victor Geraci a noted wine historian and professor at UC Berkeley during our 125th Anniversary of V. Sattui in 2010.   In his paper he spoke of the mass Italian immigration of the late 1800s and early 1900s with many of these immigrants finding a home and work in the nascent California winegrowing business.  In the dialect of their native tongue they affectionately referred to their new home in America as La Merica.La Merica honors these brave men women and children that left a home filled with poverty and political hardship to a new home filled with hope and opportunity.  I want this wine to embrace the importance of immigration not only as the foundation and building blocks of our great country but also for our future and continued greatness as a nation of immigrants.  La Merica rejoices everything that is great about America: Freedom Transparency Opportunity Choice Due Process Acceptance and Diversity.”  – V. Sattui President Tom Davies</description>

        <title>2020 Napa Valley Chardonnay</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2020 Napa Valley Chardonnay is made from a delightful blend of our estate vineyard fruit. A majority (62%) of which comes from Hibbard Ranch located in Los Carneros. This appellation lies on the border of both Napa and Sonoma Counties but unlike other cool-climate AVA’s in Sonoma County Los Carneros receives much less rainfall and it is farther from the ocean.  The area’s dense clay soils are not particularly deep or fertile and these factors when combined create a powerful Chardonnay with concentrated fruit flavors.The remainder of the blend (38%) is sourced from Carsi Vineyard just down the road in Yountville. It is a 27-acre vineyard named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace the Italian hillside village of Carsi. This appellation is one of the coolest wine growing regions in Napa Valley which contributes to a long growing season and full-flavored fruit.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into 100% French oak barrels for fermentation. We typically divide the Chardonnay juice into four different lots; three of them will be inoculated with a different yeast strain; each one capable of producing different aromatic compounds while one lot will undergo a native fermentation with no yeast addition. Once primary fermentation has been completed, winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation, also referred to as secondary fermentation. The completion of malolactic fermentation will aid in providing a creamier texture with a fuller mouthfeel. All lots are stirred biweekly through malolactic and will age on its lees for nine months until racked out for blending and bottling.</description>

        <title>2020 Napa Valley Syrah</title>
        <description>Our 2020 Napa Valley Syrah utilizes four different clones that are grown in three different appellations throughout Napa Valley. With careful consideration we’ve planted each clone in its optimal climate so that our finished wine displays beautiful aromatics with rich full-bodied complexity and strong tannin structure.Vittorio’s Vineyard (clones 470 and 383) in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years.Just down the road in Yountville at Carsi Vineyard (clone 174) named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace- the Italian hillside village of Carsi there is a combination of soil types and microclimates that make this location perfect for growing different varietals.Last but certainly not least we have a single acre of Syrah planted at our estate ranch in Mt. Veeder (clone 877) where the San Pablo Bay allows the fruit to mature slowly developing incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time of the grapes.</description>

        <title>2020 Pilgrim Vineyard Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Pilgrim Vineyard is a 12-acre parcel located in the Lodi AVA, which lies just between Sacramento and Stockton, extending east until it runs into the Sierra Foothills AVA. This lovely vineyard is owned by Joel and Martine Herche, who after moving sixteen times in sixteen years, ended their pilgrimage in 1998 by finally settling down on this vineyard. They playfully named it for John Bunyan’s work, “The Pilgrim’s Progress”. The vines are certified to be at least 70 years old, but are reputed to be much older and are flourishing. Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50 F. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel tank where a peak temperature is typically 92 0F; and the yeast strain is Premier Cuvee. The wine is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the skins and seeds.For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin content.

        <title>2020 Quaglia Vineyard Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Tiny Quaglia (Italian for “quail”) Vineyard is actually two separate parcels in St. Helena about a mile apart. One parcel is on Spring Street on the west side of town; the other is on Pratt Avenue just north of town. When Ray Quaglia's forefathers acquired this land in the early 1930’s it had already been farmed for fifty years by the Valley's early Italian growers. Back in the day it was customary to plant &quot;field blends&quot; different grape varieties alongside each other which when picked altogether produced the blend that was desired in the bottle. Needless to say most of the vines are Zinfandel but there are varying amounts of Petite Sirah and Carignane throughout the vineyard as well for added color and flavor complexity.</description>

        <title>2020 Ramazzotti Vineyard Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The head-trained vines from Ramazzotti Vineyard located in Sonoma County’s Dry Creek Valley were planted in 1982 from the Mazzoni clone thought to be one of the original heritage clones dating back to the mid- 19th century. It is on a southwest-facing slope above the fog line allowing the afternoon sun to fully ripen the grapes. Its shallow soils and an impenetrable layer of rock below naturally balance the vines so they’ve never overproduced. Although the yields per acre are miniscule the resulting wines are expansive works of art. Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF.

        <title>2020 Russian River Pinot Noir</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our Russian River Pinot Noir is composed of grapes from our estate vineyard which is nestled among the rolling hillsides that wind alongside the Russian River in Sonoma County. The Russian River Valley is strongly influenced by two key factors; weather and geology. The coastal influence from the Pacific Ocean moderates the temperatures as much as 35 to 40 degrees from its daytime high. This climate promotes full flavor maturity over an extended growing season while allowing the fruit to retain its natural acidity. The combination of fractured sandstone and sandy loam soils allow the vineyards to retain water and heat which help to produce smooth round wines with less acidity and highly aromatic.</description>

        <title>2020 School House Creek Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:School House Creek Vineyard is located in the northern end of Dry Creek Valley outside of Healdsburg near Lake Sonoma. The vines were planted in 1972 to St. George rootstock and are head-trained at 10’ by 8’ spacing. The soils consist of weathered gravelly loam on a well-drained alluvial bench above the valley floor. They are “dry-farmed” meaning grown without irrigation which limits vine growth but intensifies grape flavor.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF.

        <title>2021 Boonville Ranch Pinot Noir</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:We source grapes for our Anderson Valley Pinot Noir from our very own estate ranch in Boonville. We have 11.6 acres divided into 5 small blocks each of which are planted with different Pinot Noir clones or field selection. Clone 115 667 and 777 dark pigments and rich structure and pure aromas and the Calera selection comes from cuttings from a true Burgundian clone form Josh Jenson’s Mt Harlan Vineyard as well as another selection from DRC which offer more seductive complexities.The Anderson Valley is located in the rolling hills of the coastal region of Mendocino County about two hours north of San Francisco. Only fifteen miles long half the length of Napa Valley this beautiful valley is home to a unique group of vineyards that produce a broad range of excellent wines including Burgundian varietals like Pinot Noir.  The climate is significantly influenced by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the coolest AVAs in the state as well as getting about 40 inches of rain each year also more than most wine regions.Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. About 80% of the fruit is “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to an open top stainless-steel tank. The remaining 20% of the fruit is added as whole clusters; these tend to ferment at a slower pace, preserving more fresh fruit aromas and soft tannins in the finished wine. Once all the fruit is in tank, the initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF. Each vineyard block was fermented in different stainless-steel tanks where peak temperature is typically 92ºF; and the yeast strain is RC212. Once fermentation begins, the grape skins and solids rise to the surface because of the carbon dioxide gas that fermentation creates. The tank is lightly punched down twice a day to ensure the fruit cap, which is the source of color, is mixed with the fermenting juice. Not only does this aid in extracting color and tannins from the fruit cap, but also homogenizing tank fermentation temperature to preserve delicate aromas and flavors. The juice is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the skins and seeds.For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin content. Once these are at an optimum in the wine, we drain the free-run juice from the skins to another tank and keep separate the hard press wine, which will be evaluated and aged separately. Once the new wine has settled in tank (3-4 days) we rack off the gross grape solids (lees) and move to barrels. The 2nd fermentation (called Malolactic) will then proceed in small barrels over several months.&quot;Fully ripe black cherry fruit is the driving force of this ample fairly fleshy youngster yet if made in a somewhat fuller style the wine is very well-structured and does not give itself over to over-the-top ripeness and maintains good varietal focus from start to finish. It is underpinned by enough tannin to argue for a few years of cellaring but it shows good fruity depth throughout its length and its closing drift to grippy astringency is not at all out of bounds for a wine of its age.&quot; - Connoisseurs' Guide</description>

        <title>2021 Boonville Ranch Riesling</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The grapes for this wine are grown in Anderson Valley which is only about 16 miles long and up to 1½ miles wide surrounded on three sides by rolling hills and low mountains and open to the west through majestic old- and second-growth redwoods to the Pacific Ocean along the Navarro River. With the coastal influence keeping temperatures cool grapes are allowed to develop slowly ripen evenly and develop their characteristically exotic flavors over time while preserving acidity. This vineyard is planted utilizing a VSP trellis system which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy to increases their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into another tank where it will undergo fermentation at a very cold temperature, typically 52ºF; and the yeast strain is ICVGRE. Before fermentation is complete, we halt fermentation by chilling the tank, in order to leave a very small amount of natural grape sugar to balance the acid levels. The finished wine is then lightly filtered and bottled just a few months after its harvest in an effort to capture the freshest, fruitiest aromas and flavors.</description>

        <title>2021 Collina D'oro Pinot Noir</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Collina d’Oro Vineyard is located in the Russian River AVA in Sonoma County. This region is famous for its unique “Gold Ridge soils and cool coastal influence perfect for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. The Russian River Valley is strongly influenced by two key factors; weather and geology. The coastal influence from the Pacific Ocean moderates the temperatures as much as 35 to 40 degrees from its daytime high. This climate promotes full flavor maturity over an extended growing season while allowing the fruit to retain its natural acidity. The combination of fractured sandstone and sandy loam soils allow the vineyards to retain water and heat which help to produce smooth round wines with less acidity that are highly aromatic.&quot;Spot-on in its varietal focus and boasting plenty of pure red and black cherry fruit with accents of sweet slightly caramelly oak lending an extra bit of richness and range V. Sattui’s Collina d’Oro bottling is at once lively and nicely ripened with fine fruity energy and length. Albeit very young and structured to clearly benefit from age it is surprisingly easy to taste for an ambitious Pinot Noir that is barely a year old...&quot; - Connoisseurs' Guide</description>

        <title>2021 Dancing Egg Riesling</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Our 2021 Mt. Veeder Dry Riesling was produced using estate grown fruit from only a single block at Hibbard Ranch located in the Mount Veeder sub-appellation of Napa Valley. The cool Mt. Veeder appellation overlooking the San Pablo Bay allows the fruit to mature slowly developing incredibly rich concentrated flavors with the extended hang-time of the grapes. Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled the clear juice is then racked into our “egg-shaped” concrete tank and aged sur-lies for four months; the yeast strain is ICVGRE. This method of fermentation gives the wine a little roundness while preserving the fruit. The finished wine is then lightly filtered and bottled just a few months after its harvest in an effort to capture the freshest fruitiest aromas and flavors.</description>

        <title>2021 Los Carneros Chardonnay</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2021 Los Carneros Chardonnay was crafted using fruit from our estate vineyard, Hibbard Ranch in Los Carneros. This cool appellation overlooks the San Pablo Bay, where summer average temperatures range from 50 to 90F, making it an ideal site for Burgundian varietals. The cool summer nights allow the fruit to retain its acidity while warmer days bring the maturity to perfection. These vines are farmed utilizing a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system, which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into 100% French oak barrels for fermentation. We typically divide the Chardonnay from this vineyard into four different lots; three of them will be inoculated with a different yeast strain; each one capable of producing different aromatic compounds while one lot will undergo a native fermentation with no yeast addition. Once primary fermentation has been completed, winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation, also referred to as secondary fermentation. The completion of malolactic fermentation will aid in providing a creamier texture with a fuller mouth-feel. All lots are stirred biweekly through malolactic and will age on its lees for nine months until racked out for blending and bottling. </description>

        <title>2021 Los Carneros Pinot Noir</title>
        <description>Vineyard NotesOur 2021 Los Carneros Pinot Noir is a glorious representation of this world-renowned viticultural area. The fruit for this wine comes from our estate vineyard Hibbard Ranch located along Carneros Creek and adjacent to the Mt. Veeder AVA. It is planted to four different clones Dijon selections 115 and 777 clone 828 and Pommard clone 5 all grafted to 44-53 rootstocks on a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system.  The VSP trellis forces clusters to the outside of the canopy to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions. Summer average temperatures range from 50 to 90 F which makes it ideal site for these varietals.  Cool summer nights retain the acidity and hot days bring the maturity to perfection.</description>

        <title>2021 Muscat</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our ever-popular Muscat is crafted from 100% Estate grown grapes in Solano County. This county lies just South of Napa County and is known for its alluvial soils deposited on the flat valley floors over many years by rivers running through the area.  Solano County enjoys a maritime climate due to the close proximity of the Sacramento Delta. Ocean breezes and fog from both Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay help to cool the vineyards which extends the growing season and leads to grapes that produce balanced wines with good acidity and phenolic ripeness.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into another tank where it will undergo fermentation at a very cold temperature, typically 52ºF; and the yeast strain is ICVGRE.

        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2021 North Coast Semillon sources fruit from both of our Estate properties in Anderson Valley Los Carneros in Napa Valley and Yountville in Napa Valley. With the coastal influence of the bay keeping temperatures cool and chance of late-season rain minimal grapes are allowed to develop slowly ripen evenly and develop fruit flavors over time while preserving acidity. These vineyards utilize a VSP trellis system for their vines which forces clusters of fruit to the outside of the canopy to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance ripening under cool climate conditions.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold.

        <title>2022 Bacci Bianco</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes Our 2022 Bacci Bianco is made from a delightful blend of our estate vineyard fruit. A majority of which comes from Hibbard Ranch (82%) located in Los Carneros. This appellation lies on the border of both Napa and Sonoma Counties, but unlike other cool-climate AVA’s in Sonoma County, Los Carneros receives much less rainfall, and it is farther from the ocean.  The area’s dense, clay soils are not particularly deep or fertile, and these factors when combined create a powerful Chardonnay with concentrated fruit flavors. We also chose to incorporate a touch of fruit (18%) from our estate vineyard in Solano County.  This county lies just South of Napa County, and is known for its alluvial soils, deposited on the flat valley floors over many years by rivers running through the area.  Solano County enjoys a maritime climate due to the close proximity of the Sacramento Delta. Ocean breezes and fog from both Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay help to cool the vineyards, which extends the growing season and leads to grapes that produce balanced wines with good acidity and phenolic ripeness. Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into another tank where it will undergo fermentation at a very cold temperature, typically 52ºF; and the yeast strain is ICVGRE.  Before fermentation is complete, we halt fermentation by chilling the tank, in order to leave a small amount of natural grape sugar to balance the acid levels. The finished wine is then lightly filtered and bottled just a few months after its harvest in an effort to capture the freshest, fruitiest aromas and flavors. </description>

        <title>2022 Dry Riesling</title>
        <description>Vineyard NotesOur 2022 Mt. Veeder Dry Riesling was produced from a single vineyard block located at our estate property Hibbard Ranch. While a section of this estate falls in the Los Carneros designated appellation a small portion of our upper blocks are in the separate sub-appellation of Mt. Veeder which lies above the fog line. The rugged mountain elevations have complex marine Franciscan Formation soils with metamorphosed marine sediments such as Haire loam Cole silt loam Fagan clay loam and Felton gravelly loam with small amounts of more recent Sonoma Volcanic soils. The cool Mt. Veeder appellation overlooking the San Pablo Bay allows the fruit to mature slowly developing incredibly rich concentrated flavors with the extended hang-time of the grapes. Winemaking NotesThe grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled the clear juice is then racked into another tank where it will undergo fermentation at a very cold temperature typically 52ºF; and the yeast strain is ICVGRE.  Before fermentation is complete we halt fermentation by chilling the tank in order to leave a very small amount of natural grape sugar to balance the acid levels. The finished wine is then lightly filtered and bottled just a few months after its harvest in an effort to capture the freshest fruitiest aromas and flavors.</description>

        <title>2022 Gamay Rouge</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Gamay Noir grapes we source for this bright refreshing wine are from our estate vineyard on Solano County. This varietal is most famous for producing the light, effervescent, fruit forward red wines of Beaujolais in eastern France. Characteristically these wines see no barrel aging at all and are enjoyed only weeks after harvest when they are fresh and vibrant. To honor tradition and pay homage to this varietal’s heritage we pick these grapes when they are lower in sugars and higher in acids to preserve the freshness and capture it in bottle to be enjoyed in any season.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into another tank where it will undergo fermentation at a very cold temperature, typically 52ºF; and the yeast strain is Premier Cuvee.  Before fermentation is complete, we halt fermentation by chilling the tank, in order to leave a small amount of natural grape sugar to balance the acid levels. The finished wine is then lightly filtered and bottled just a few months after its harvest in an effort to capture the freshest, fruitiest aromas and flavors. </description>

        <title>2022 Moscato</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:While the translation of this wine from Italian to the English language may be simple, “Muscat Sparkling,” this wine is anything but simplistic. We crafted this sparkling, sweet delight from 75% of our estate grown Muscat while supplementing the remainder of the blend with fruit from one of our beloved growers in Anderson Valley. Fruit from both vineyard locations benefit from a transverse mountain range topography (East to West) with varying soil types, and a collage of microclimates that keep the regions cool. The chill of the fog and breezes from the ocean help extend the growing season, allowing the grapes to fully riper without excessive sugar levels- a key factor behind what makes this wine so elegant and unique. Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50F. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into another tank where it will undergo fermentation at a very cold temperature, typically 52ºF; and the yeast strain is ICVGRE. Before fermentation is complete, we halt fermentation by chilling the tank, in order to leave a small amount of natural grape sugar to balance the acid levels.

        <title>2022 Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2022 Napa Valley Sauvignon
Blanc is a refreshing blend that showcases our estate vineyard fruit. A
majority (55%) of the blend comes from Carsi Vineyard located in Yountville. It is a 27-acre vineyard named in honor of
Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace, the Italian hillside village of Carsi. This
appellation is one of the coolest wine growing regions in Napa Valley, which
contributes to a long growing season and full-flavored fruit.

 The
remainder of the blend (45%) is sourced from just down the road at Hibbard Ranch
in Los Carneros. This appellation lies on the border of both Napa and Sonoma
Counties, but unlike other cool-climate AVAs in Sonoma County, Los Carneros
receives much less rainfall, and it is farther from the ocean. The area’s
dense, clay soils are not particularly deep or fertile, and these factors when
combined produce fruit with concentrated flavors.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving
at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the
juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at
50F. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then
racked into another vessel where it will undergo fermentation at a very cold
temperature, typically 52F; and the yeast strain is SL3. This is a special
yeast strain, ideal for fermentations with varietals that are exceptionally
aromatic to preserve these fruit forward characteristics.



A majority of the blend (95%)
was fermented in stainless steel tank which preserves the crisp, natural
Sauvignon Blanc varietal flavors. A small portion of the blend (2.5%) was
fermented in our concrete egg, which
creates body and richness on the palate, whilst imparting hints of minerality
to the aroma. The remainder of the blend (2.5%) was fermented in French Oak
barrels to increase complexity of aromas and flavors. Once fermentation was complete, wines from each vessel
were blended, lightly filtered, and bottled just a few months after its harvest
to capture the freshest, fruitiest aromas and flavors.</description>

        <title>2022 Off-dry Riesling</title>
        <description>Vineyard NotesFor our 2022 Off-Dry Riesling, we decided that to best capture the essence of California, we would combine the grapes grown from our estate vineyard in Anderson Valley, with fruit from another well-known coastal climate Santa Barbara County. With the coastal influence keeping temperatures cool, grapes are allowed to develop slowly, ripen evenly, and develop their characteristically exotic flavors over time while preserving acidity. Both vineyards are planted utilizing a VSP trellis system, which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy, to increases their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.Winemaking NotesThe grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into another tank where it will undergo fermentation at a very cold temperature, typically 52ºF; and the yeast strain is ICVGRE. Before fermentation is complete, we halt fermentation by chilling the tank, in order to leave a small amount of natural grape sugar to balance the acid levels.

        <title>2022 Tre Uve Bianco</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Tre Uve Bianco (Italian for “three white grapes”) is our newest addition to the V. Sattui family. This delightfully, refreshing white blend is the result of harmonizing three very exciting varietals into one wine: Chenin Blanc, Albariño, and Pinot Grigio. These are the newest grapes to be grown at our estate vineyard Hibbard Ranch in Los Carneros. This renowned growing region’s cool summer nights allow the fruit to retain its acidity while warmer days bring the maturity to perfection. Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed, and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into another tank where it will undergo fermentation at a very cold temperature, typically 52ºF; and the yeast strain is R2.  Before fermentation is complete, we halt fermentation by chilling the tank, in order to leave a small amount of natural grape sugar to balance the acid levels. The finished wine is then lightly filtered and bottled just a few months after its harvest in an effort to capture the freshest, fruitiest aromas and flavors. </description>

        <title>Angelica</title>
        <description>Angelica is a full-bodied and elegant liqueur-like wine.  It's sweeter than most ports with a light amber to pale-salmon color and a smooth silky mouthfeel. We arrest the fermentation of the wine at an early stage with the addition of an almost 20-year-old pot-still brandy from Carneros causing the grapes to retain the maximum of their sugar content around 15% residual and an alcohol of about 18%. Store in a cool spot chill in the refrigerator just before opening and serve as an aperitif or dessert wine. After opening it will keep well in the refrigerator for weeks or months.</description>

        <title>Madeira</title>
        <description>Winemaking Notes:The solera process is an ingenious system of fractional blending perfected by the Spanish to ensure consistent quality based on the fact that old wines can be refreshed by the addition of a younger wine which then acquires the characteristics of the old wine. We begin with now what is now a 107-year-old vintage port, a lasting vestige from Vittorio Sattui's original winery as the mother (or master-blend). We then fashion primary secondary and tertiary blends &quot;criaderas&quot; using varying ages of Zinfandel - the oldest is more than 35 years old - and add a little back to the mother to keep it alive much like sourdough breadmaking. Over the years our Madeira has won a chest-full of Gold Medals and accolades. A noted wine columnist for the Times and Star in the U.K. Gerald Richardson wrote: “V. Sattui Madeira…is without a doubt the best Madeira in the world…”LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT MAKES OUR MADEIRA SPECIAL:HOW TO OPEN A BOTTLE OF MADEIRA:STORING MADEIRA:  Although our Madeira will age up to several years in perfect cellar conditions after being opened, we recommend it be consumed within 1-3 years after opening. Store it upright in our cupboard like you would a spirit.</description>
