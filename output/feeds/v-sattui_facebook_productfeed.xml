        <title>20 Year Old Port</title>
        <description>Winemaking Notes:Produced from 100% Napa Valley fruit and made in the traditional port style. Our 20-year old Port comes from a blend of several Port wines made with traditional Port varieties- Tinta Cao Tinta Madera Souzao and Touriga Nacional.The wine was bottled after aging in small oak casks for a minimum of 20 years although some are more than twenty five years in barrel. It’s tawny plum color and caramelized aromas come from the long aging process in barrels giving the wine a unique spicy character and sweet oak tones to go along with the cocoa raspberry and milk chocolate bouquet.  The lively acidity and berry flavors pair with aged cheeses (especially blue cheese) and charcuterie with other savory foods like roasted meats and game. Red port with rare duck breast or duck confit is delicious also.</description>

        <title>2003 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>VINEYARD NOTESThis wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench” below Mt. St. John in the Mayacamas range. Gary is a third-generation farmer in a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained Bale Clay Loam gravelly soils producing fine- grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-west by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993. </description>

        <title>2004 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Preston Vineyard, one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years, is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity. The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest. This magnum is 1.5L equal to 2 regular wine bottles and serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2005 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Grown in the foothills of the Mayacamas mountains in the upper reaches our Henry Ranch estate, our Mt. Veeder Cabernet, with a touch of Petite Verdot, has distinctive blueberry, tobacco and black olive flavors that are ripe and complex. Poor, acidic soils and the mountain environment create a more tightly-wound, focused flavor profile and firm, yet fine-grained tannins.Vineyard Notes:The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allow the fruit to mature slowly in this Estate property allowing the development of incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <title>2006 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Located in the rugged Mayacamas Mountains at elevations ranging from 1250-1400 ft., our Mt. Veeder Estate is situated in a unique microclimate offering cooler temperatures during the day with warmer temperatures at night. Planted on ancient marine soils, the fruit in this vineyard develops slowly and steadily until full phenolic ripeness is reached. Often the very last of our vineyards to be harvested; our Mt. Veeder Estate offers small yields of deeply pigmented, intensely flavored fruit which produce wines of complexity, power and elegance that speak to their provenance year after year.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2007 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vittorio's Vineyard about thirty acres adjacent to the winery on the south side is planted about half to Cabernet Sauvignon. The soils are gravelly loam and marginally fertile which stresses the vines and produces excellent quality grapes. The vineyard enjoys a microclimate that is perfectly suited to Cabernet and the four other varieties (Merlot Petit Verdot Syrah &amp; Zinfandel) planted there. Vines are spaced 2 x 4 which causes the root balls to compete with one another and they are trained to a vertical curtain. The vines are stressed to the point where we take a European farming approach with our workers making three passes through the vineyard towards the latter part of the season to drop (or thin) clusters so that the vines can fully ripen their load.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <title>2008 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench” below Mt. St. John in the Mayacamas range. Gary is a third-generation farmer in a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained Bale Clay Loam gravelly soils producing fine- grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993.(Limit: 6 per person)</description>

        <description>&quot;We are trying to achieve a clear balance and harmony among the components&quot; says Brooks Painter Director of Winemaking.  &quot;The different attributes of each grape engage masterfully with one another to create an extremely enjoyable drinking experience - a real marvel of a wine. Enjoy!&quot;This premium proprietary blend which we have named Paradiso (Pahr-a DEEZ-0h) consists of Cabernet Sauvignon (89%) Merlot (8%) and Petit Verdot (3%).  The Cabernet Sauvignon comes from Preston Vineyard one of our top Rutherford Appellation vineyards while the Merlot is from our Henry Ranch and finally the Petit Verdot is from the excellent &quot;Vittorio's Vineyard&quot; adjacent to the winery in St. Helena.  The dusty mocha and cassis-filled Rutherford Cabernet combines with cool-climate elegant Carneros Merlot which is then topped off with the inky cedary aromatic Vittorio's Vineyard Petit Verdot.(Limit: 3 per person)</description>

        <title>2008 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity.  The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.(Limit: 2 per person)&quot;...it's exceptionally ripe in blackberry and cherry fruit with a liqueur richness of crème de cassis and it should have no trouble in the cellar.&quot; - Wine Enthusiast</description>

        <description>The majority of our Cabernet Sauvignon originates from Preston Vineyard, one of our premier AVA sites in the Rutherford Appellation, with additional contributions from the new Coombsville AVA and Mt Veeder. Our Merlot is sourced from our Henry Ranch estate in Los Carneros, while the Petit Verdot comes from our Vittorio's Vineyard estate, located adjacent to the winery in St. Helena. The dusty Rutherford fruit harmonizes beautifully with the cool-climate Cabernet lots, while the Carneros Merlot adds red cherry aromas and supple tannins. A touch of the cedary, aromatic Petit Verdot from Vittorio's Vineyard introduces a mineral aspect, backbone, and intensity to the blend. This results in an altogether elegant composition that is delightful now and promises to age wonderfully for years to come.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2009 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Preston Vineyard, one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years, is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity. The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest. This magnum is 1.5L equal to 2 regular wine bottles and serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2009 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <description>Vineyard Notes:Tiny Morisoli Vineyard sits at the foot of Mt. St. John on the western edge of the renowned Rutherford Bench from which many of Napa Valley's finest Cabernets are born. The bench land is slightly elevated and considerably flat with gravelly and sandy loam deposited from millennia of ancient creeks meandering through it on the way to the river. The vineyard is almost entirely organic and no herbicides are ever applied.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <description>125th Anniversary Vintage &quot;The Morisoli Vineyard has long been one of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards in the Napa Valley and it consistently produces one of the strongest Cabs in the V. Sattui arsenal. This beautiful wine is rich and dense on the palate with a nose of cassis and ripe blackberry and spice. The oak is beautifully judged lending warmth and a hint of spice. This smooth supple gem of a Cab took gold at the Winemaker Challenge International Wine Competition in San Diego recently.&quot;</description>

        <description>The hillside location of this vineyard is ideal for Cabernet as it sits above the fog line enjoying warmer days and cooler nights.  This lovely Cabernet shows expressive mountain-bred fruit flavors of crushed berry cassis and plum punctuated by bright herbal notes and cedar.

        <title>2010 Paradiso</title>
        <description>Powerful nuanced and impeccably balanced.  This is V. Sattui's fourth vintage of Paradiso our red proprietary Bordeaux-style blend that changes in varietal composition from vintage to vintage. The Cabernet comes from three different vineyard locations:  40-year old vines from Preston Vineyard in Rutherford bringing bright very and ripe dusty notes; hillside VSP-trained vines at Henry Ranch in the cooler Mt. Veeder appellation offering color and concentrated fruit flavors; and the gravelly soils of Morisoli Vineyard on the Rutherford Bench where volcanic deposits as well as alluvial deposits produce big muscular Cabernets. The Merlot is also from Henry Ranch in Los Carneros where the deeper soils near Carneros Creek provide excellent pigment and fine-grain tannins in the wine; and the Petite Verdot comes from Vittorio's Vineyard our certified organic vineyard adjacent to V. Sattui winery in St. Helena.Best of Class - San Francisco International Wine Competition  Limit to 2 per customer</description>

        <title>2010 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Some of California's most sought-after and expensive wines come out of the Rutherford AVA, the historical core of the Napa Valley and from where V. Sattui has been producing Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignons for more than thirty-three years. Cabernet performs marvelously here giving sumptuous wines of great profundity and longevity; and its preeminence here is no new idea. Gustave Niebaum's 19th-century Inglenook made Cabernets in 1887-89 that still survive and Georges de Latour knew in 1900 that his BV Cabernets had world class results as well. Preston Vineyard is but a stone's throw from these great estates.It's thought that the secret to Rutherford Cabernet lies in the gravelly loam soil and the well-drained bench lands at the foot of the Mayacamas Mountains just west of the town of Rutherford. &quot;Rutherford dust&quot; is the catchword for the particular character imparted by sun and soil here; and it's no mistake that vintage after vintage the compelling trait in our Preston Cabernets is its dusty leathery cigar-box quality that frames the delicious fruit that we always receive from this coveted 28-acre parcel.</description>

        <title>2010 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>Vittorio's Vineyard about thirty acres adjacent to the winery on the south side is planted about half to Cabernet Sauvignon. The soils are gravelly loam and marginally fertile which stresses the vines and produces excellent quality grapes. The vineyard enjoys a microclimate that is perfectly suited to Cabernet and the four other varieties (Merlot Petit Verdot Syrah &amp; Zinfandel) planted there.</description>

        <title>2011 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench”. Gary is a third-generation farmer on this property a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained gravelly soils which produce fine-grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grapes to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993.</description>

        <title>2011 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This vineyard with perhaps the southernmost vines in the Mt. Veeder AVA produces a focused herb-tinged Cabernet with fine tannins and a long elegant finish.  The hillside location of this vineyard is ideal for Cabernet as it sits above the fog line enjoying warmer days and cooler nights.  This lovely Cabernet shows expressive mountain-bred fruit flavors of crushed berry cassis and plum punctuated by bright herbal notes and cedar.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <title>2011 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>The 2011 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon has an opaque deep purple-black color with juicy fresh black cherry black olive and cassis in the nose. The subtle oak bouquet has nice chocolate and cedary aromatics. It is silky on the palate with sweet black fruit flavors that are nicely balanced with a full-bodied rich texture that finishes with soft tannins.Vineyard Notes: Some of California's most sought-after and expensive wines come out of the Rutherford AVA, the historical core of the Napa Valley and from where V. Sattui has been producing Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignons for more than thirty-three years. Cabernet performs marvelously here giving sumptuous wines of great profundity and longevity; and its preeminence here is no new idea. Gustave Niebaum's 19th-century Inglenook made Cabernets in 1887-89 that still survive and Georges de Latour knew in 1900 that his BV Cabernets had world class results as well. Preston Vineyard is but a stone's throw from these great estates. It's thought that the secret to Rutherford Cabernet lies in the gravelly loam soil and the well-drained bench lands at the foot of the Mayacamas Mountains just west of the town of Rutherford. &quot;Rutherford dust&quot; is the catchword for the particular character imparted by sun and soil here; and it's no mistake that vintage after vintage the compelling trait in our Preston Cabernets is its dusty leathery cigar-box quality that frames the delicious fruit that we always receive from this coveted 28-acre parcel.&quot;Rich and slightly chewy, V. Sattui's 2011 Preston Vineyard Cab is a Cab lover's Cabernet... Though richly extracted, the Preston is well balanced and inviting now even though it will not hit its peak for some time.&quot; - Robert Whitley(Limit: 6 per person)</description>

        <title>2011 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>&quot;Rich and slightly chewy V. Sattui's 2011 Preston Vineyard Cab is a Cab lover's Cabernet. Dense and layered it shows ripe dark fruits supported by firm tannins that will need another two to three years to come around. Those who have the patience to cellar this big bad Napa red should hold it until at least 2018 but 2021 to 2025 would be optimum. Though richly extracted the Preston is well balanced and inviting now even though it will not hit its peak for some time. This wine was awarded a platinum medal at the 2014 Sommelier Challenge wine competition.&quot;</description>

        <title>2011 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>This vintage is 84% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot with a finishing dose of Malbec and Syrah. The Cabernet Petit Verdot and Syrah come from our Vittorio's Vineyard. We have six Cabernet blocks about two acres each with different clones including Clone 6 (also known as the Jackson clone which produces small berries loose clusters and very concentrated fruit). The Malbec comes from our Carsi Vineyard in Yountville and gives additional color and intensity to the blend.Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton Loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <description>&quot;Winemaker Brooks Painter and his crew always bring out all that Morisoli has to offer and in this vintage it's lively raspberry fruit joined perfectly by pie spice mild dried herbs cedar and cigar. It's got a big structured backbone that begs further aging while providing great delight at present. Decant or go long? You win either way.&quot;</description>

        <title>2012 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Deep aromas of blackberry, cassis, bay leaf, and brown spice prepare you for a mouth filling structured glass that shows supple mountain tannins serving to translate the aromas directly to palate flavors.  This wine is fabulous right now and will bring even greater rewards 10 years down the road.Vineyard Notes:The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allow the fruit to mature slowly in this Estate property allowing the development of incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <description>This is V. Sattui's sixth vintage of Paradiso our red Proprietary Bordeaux-style blend that changes in varietal composition from vintage to vintage.  2012 will be a vintage to remember. Near perfect weather conditions resulted in a rare combination of high quality fruit and an abundant crop. As it is still a relative youngster upon release it is dense and a bit sinewy on the palate suggesting a good five to eight years of aging; yet its opulent fruit flavors are lingering and its elegant texture and polished tannins suggest balance and obvious depth proving that lengthy keeping will come as a bet without risk.

        <description>From one of our flagship vineyard sources this Rutherford Cabernet is both powerful and complex.&quot;The juggernaut that is V. Sattui Winery continues to roll out spectacular Cabernet Sauvignon from this vineyard.  The nose is extremely deep and complex with solid varietal character firm tannic structure lively acidity and a long finish that is currently emphasizing elegant red fruit and spice. This deserves five to ten years additional bottle aging to bring out all of its charms though they are already many.  A Platinum Award winner and Best of Class Cabernet Sauvignon at the 2015 Sommelier Challenge International Wine Competition.&quot;95 points Rich Cook Sep 15 2015</description>

        <title>2013 Black-sears Vineyard Zinfandel - Magnum</title>
        <description>This wine has impressive structure with firm gripping tannins and excellent acidity; benefits of Napa County's highest vineyard which is also biodynamically farmed and certified organic. What's best about this wine is the impeccable balance it shows off. This is a Zinfandel made in a style that is both restrained and loaded with flavor. The V. Sattui Black Sears Zinfandel is delicious today however those with patience will be rewarded. This wine is an ager to be sure. It'll improve over the next 5-8 years and drink well for at least 4-6 after that.Vineyard Notes:Black-Sears Vineyard is located in the Howell Mountain sub-appellation of Napa Valley. It was planted in 1975 and, at an elevation of 2400 ft., one of the highest vineyards in Napa County.  Soils are rocky and porous which allows for good drainage.  Black-Sears vineyard blooms later in the season due to the cooler climates on the mountain and so harvest is generally later in the fall.  The original vine cuttings came from the old Hayne Vineyard in St. Helena, one of the “Heritage Clones” of Zinfandel. The vines are head trained and the grapes are cultivated organically and bio-dynamically, requiring extra care and attention to bring to full maturity.  The vines are head trained they look like a big goblet.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2013 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:  Carsi Vineyard lies about thirteen miles south of the winery in a wide flat basin just north of the town of Napa. It's a cooler zone of heavier soils where Chardonnay does exceptionally well. V. Sattui purchased the land in 1989 and invested heavily in soil amendments fertilization and trellising of the existing vines before naming it after my great-grandfather Vittorio's Italian village in the mountains above Genoa. We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time.Winemaking Notes: Grapes are picked at night and delivered to the winery in half ton macro bins.  Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is settled for 24 hours at 50ºF, and then racked off the grape solids.  Specialty Chardonnay fermenting yeast is added to the must, and then it is transferred to barrels where it will start barrel fermentation.  Native fermentations will go to barrels without any yeast.  Once alcoholic fermentation is completed winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation.  All lots will be stirred biweekly through malolactic, and will stay on its lees until racked out for blending and bottling. 1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2013 Los Carneros Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Huichica Creek Vineyard (59%) is located in Los Carneros, Napa Valley AVA, close to the San Francisco Bay and it has VSP trellis with three clones of Chardonnay: UCD Clone 5, Dijon  Clone 95 and the “Old Wente” Clone, all on 101-14 rootstock. The Henry Ranch (41%) is also located in Los Carneros, Napa Valley AVA, but it at a higher elevation and farther away from the bay, along Carneros Creek and adjacent to the Mt Veeder AVA. It is planted to the Dijon selections 96 and 76 on 5C rootstock on a VSP trellis system, and the “Old Wente” clone on 101-14 rootstock on a modified “High V” trellis. The Dijon clones tend to be earlier ripening, with softer acidity while the UCD clone 5 has a bright acidity which provides good acid balance to the blend. The “Old Wente” clone has a distinct cluster shape and size, with smaller berries that are irregular in size and it is a lower yielding clone favored by winemakers for its intensity of aroma and flavor.Winemaking Notes:Grapes are picked at night and delivered to the winery in half ton macro bins.  They are loaded in the press whole cluster.  The juice is settled for 24 hours at 50ºF then racked.  Specialty Chardonnay fermenting yeast is added to the tank then transferred to barrels where it will be fermented.  Native, “indigenous yeast” fermentations (15-30% of total) are transferred to barrels without any added yeast.  Once the primary alcoholic fermentation is completed winemaking will determine which lots will go through a secondary, malolactic fermentation.  All lots are stirred biweekly in a process known as &quot;battonage&quot; to re-suspend the yeast.  All lots will stay on its lees &quot;sur-lie&quot; until lots are racked out for blending and bottling. 1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2013 Morisoli Vineyard Caberent Sauvignon - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli's Vineyard located in the heart of the famed &quot;Rutherford Bench&quot;. Gary is a third-generation farmer on this property a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained gravelly soils which produce fine-grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a &quot;V-trellis&quot; that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grapes to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993.</description>

        <title>2013 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allow the fruit to mature slowly in this Estate property allowing the development of incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.One of our darkest cabernets with incredibly inky color it has ripe aromas of plum cherry fruit black olive and dried savory herbs in the nose. It is soft and very elegant on the palate with a round supple texture.  Cassis and black cherry fruit flavors linger on the finish.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <description>Paradiso is our red “Meritage” a Bordeaux-style wine that is a blend of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon 21% Merlot 3% Malbec and 3% Petite Verdot.

The oak is well-integrated; it balances the wine’s natural acidity and provides a bouquet of cocoa black licorice and tobacco notes.  It shows lingering opulent fruit flavors an elegant texture and polished tannins in a long finish.</description>

        <title>2013 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity.  The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.</description>

        <title>2013 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>94% Cabernet Sauvignon 4% Merlot 2% Petit Verdot  Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton Loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.  2013 was an unusually dry year. Spring only brought less than 5” of rain and the warm days set the stage for an ideal flowering and fruit set conditions. Temperatures were optimal for vine activity resulting in healthy vines as fruit went through veraison and grapes started maturing. August 1st was the start of harvest earliest recorded in recent history. White varietals came first followed by lighter reds. The warm temperatures throughout October allowed the later maturing varietals to hang and come to perfect phenolic ripeness. 2013 vintage was early and came in full rage two weeks early but the quality it delivered was exceptional.</description>

        <title>2014 Anderson Valley Pinot Noir - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: The Anderson Valley is located in the rolling hills of the coastal region of Mendocino County about two hours north of San Francisco. Only fifteen miles long half the length of Napa Valley this beautiful valley is home to a unique group of vineyards that produce a broad range of excellent wines including Burgundian varietals like Pinot Noir. The climate is significantly influenced by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the coolest AVAs in the state as well as getting about 40 inches of rain each year also more than most  wine regions.Boonville is our ranch in the Anderson Valley appellation it has the name of the town itself.  There are 11.6 acres divided into 5 small blocks each planted with different Pinot Noir clone or filed selection. Clone 115, 667 and 777 dark pigments and rich structure, and pure aromas, and the Calera selection comes from cuttings from a true Burgundian clone from Josh Jenson’s Mt Harlan Vineyard, as well as another selection from DRC which offer more seductive complexities.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2014 Black-sears Vineyard Zinfandel - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: 

Black-Sears Vineyard is located in the Howell Mountain
sub-appellation of Napa Valley. It was planted in 1975 and, at an elevation of
2400 ft., one of the highest vineyards in Napa County.  Soils are rocky and porous which allows for
good drainage.  Black-Sears vineyard
blooms later in the season due to the cooler climates on the mountain and so
harvest is generally later in the fall.  The
original vine cuttings came from the old Hayne Vineyard in St. Helena, one of
the “Heritage Clones” of Zinfandel. The vines are head trained and the grapes
are cultivated organically and bio-dynamically, requiring extra care and
attention to bring to full maturity.  The
vines are head trained they look like a big goblet. 1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2014 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Carsi Vineyard lies about thirteen miles south of the winery in a wide flat basin just north of the town of Napa. It's a cooler zone of heavier soils where Chardonnay does exceptionally well. V. Sattui purchased the land in 1989 and invested heavily in soil amendments fertilization and trellising of the existing vines before naming it after my great grandfather Vittorio's Italian village in the mountains above Genoa. We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time.Winemaking Notes:

Grapes are picked at night and delivered to the winery in
half ton macro bins.  Whole clusters are pressed
and the juice is settled for 24 hours at 50ºF, and then racked off the grape solids.  Specialty Chardonnay fermenting yeast is
added to the must, and then it is transferred to barrels where it will start
barrel fermentation.  Native
fermentations will go to barrels without any yeast.  Once alcoholic fermentation is completed
winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic
fermentation.  All lots will be stirred biweekly
through malolactic, and will stay on its lees until racked out for blending and
bottling. 1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2014 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli's Vineyard located in the heart of the famed &quot;Rutherford Bench&quot;. Gary is a third-generation farmer on this property a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained gravelly soils which produce fine-grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a &quot;V-trellis&quot; that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grapes to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993.This double magnum is 3.0L equal to 4 regular wine bottles and serves 10-15 people.</description>

        <title>2014 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allow the fruit to mature slowly in this Estate property allowing the development of incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.One of our darkest cabernets with incredibly inky color it has ripe aromas of plum cherry fruit black olive and dried savory herbs in the nose. It is soft and very elegant on the palate with a round supple texture.  Cassis and black cherry fruit flavors linger on the finish.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2014 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon Magnum</title>
        <description>The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allow the fruit to mature slowly in this Estate property allowing the development of incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.One of our darkest cabernets with incredibly inky color it has ripe aromas of plum cherry fruit black olive and dried savory herbs in the nose. It is soft and very elegant on the palate with a round supple texture.  Cassis and black cherry fruit flavors linger on the finish.</description>

        <title>2014 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Preston Vineyard, one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years, is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity. The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.This magnum is 1.5L equal to 2 regular wine bottles and serves 6-8 people. </description>

        <title>2014 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton Loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.(Limit: 4 per person)</description>

        <title>2015 Anderson Valley Pinot Noir - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: The Anderson Valley is located in the rolling hills of the coastal region of Mendocino County about two hours north of San Francisco. Only fifteen miles long half the length of Napa Valley this beautiful valley is home to a unique group of vineyards that produce a broad range of excellent wines including Burgundian varietals like Pinot Noir.

There are 11.6 acres divided into 5 small blocks each planted with different Pinot Noir clone or filed selection. Clone 115, 667 and 777 dark pigments and rich structure, and pure aromas, and the Calera selection comes from cuttings from a true Burgundian clone form Josh Jenson’s Mt Harlan Vineyard, as well as another selection from DRC which offer more seductive complexities.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2015 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Carsi Vineyard lies about thirteen miles south of the winery in a wide flat basin just north of the town of Napa. It's a cooler zone of heavier sols where Chardonnay does exceptionally well. V. Sattui purchased the land in 1989 and invested heavily in soil amendments fertilization and trellising of the existing vines before naming it after my great-grandfather Vittorio's Italian village in the mountains above Genoa. We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time.Winemaking Notes: Grapes are picked at night and delivered to the winery in half ton macro bins.  Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is settled for 24 hours at 50ºF, and then racked off the grape solids.  Specialty Chardonnay fermenting yeast is added to the must, and then it is transferred to barrels where it will start barrel fermentation.  Native fermentations will go to barrels without any yeast.  Once alcoholic fermentation is completed winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation.  All lots will be stirred biweekly through malolactic, and will stay on its lees until racked out for blending and bottling. 1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2015 Grappa Riserva - Ghino Di Tacco</title>
        <description>Grappa is made by distilling the pomace (a blend of grape seeds stalks and stems) leftover from the winemaking process. The aim of distillation is not just to extract the alcohol from the pomace but also its aromas – a key characteristic of grappa. The pomace is combined with water steam then heated to start distillation. This allows the mixture to separate leaving behind a super potent beverage that is then barrel aged for 18 months before bottling.The Story of Ghino di Tacco of Siena:  The “gentleman brigand” of the Val d’OrciaGhinotto di Tacco called Ghino was an outlaw and a popular hero in thirteenth century Italy. He was born in La Fratta which is now part of Sinalunga in the Province of Siena. Born the son of a Ghibelline nobleman Tacco di Ugolino and brother of Turino he was a scion of the Cacciaconti Monacheschi Tolomei family.He began life as a robber along with his father and brother gaining fame for their outlandish plans to outwit the Siennese Republic who were determined to catch them and bring them to justice. Their luck did eventually run out when Ghino di Tacco was a teenager and they were arrested and brought to Siena. His father Tacco di Ugolino was executed in the Piazza del Campo of Siena but somehow Ghino managed to escape the same fate and fled to Radicofani.  From there he really began to make a name for himself as a loveable bandit who never robbed his victims completely but always left enough behind so they could get by with life; the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; of his time.  He even earned a mention in Dante’s ‘Divine Comedy’ in the section about purgatory.</description>

        <title>2015 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench”. Gary is a third-generation farmer on this property a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained gravelly soils which produce fine-grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground.

        <title>2015 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench”. Gary is a third-generation farmer on this property a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained gravelly soils which produce fine-grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grapes to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993. </description>

        <title>2015 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allows the fruit to mature slowly in the Estate property developing incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.</description>

        <title>2015 Preston Cabernet Sauvignon - Magnum</title>
        <description>The Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity.  The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.</description>

        <title>2015 Vintage Port</title>
        <description>Our 2015 Vintage Port is rich, complex and satisfying. A blend of traditional port varietals; each wine was aged separately and then assembled in the final blend prior to bottling.  Each of the special varieties play a role: Touriga Nacional imparts delicate aromatics and moderate tannins, Tinta Cao brings strawberry and plum fruit to the palate, Souzao delivers intense color and power while Tinta Madeira offers suppleness and classic aged mocha, cinnamon, and caramel aspects to the blend.  </description>

        <title>2015 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>&quot;A testament to what happens when great fruit and great winemaking practice come together.  Brooks Painter’s team seems to never miss with this vineyard with this vintage showing a complex mix of red and black fruit fall spice pleasantly chalky tannins and bright acidity that gives the finish a big push.  Elegant and refined.  A Platinum Award Winner at the 2018 Critics Challenge International Wine &amp; Spirits Competition.&quot;  -96 Points Rich Cook May 26th 2018 Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton Loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2016 Anderson Valley Pinot Noir - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: The Anderson Valley is located in the rolling hills of the coastal region of Mendocino County about two hours north of San Francisco. Only fifteen miles long half the length of Napa Valley this beautiful valley is home to a unique group of vineyards that produce a broad range of excellent wines including Burgundian varietals like Pinot Noir.  The climate is significantly influenced by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the coolest AVAs in the state as well as getting about 40 inches of rain each year also more than most wine regions.We source grapes for our Anderson Valley Pinot Noir from our very own estate ranch in Boonville. We have 11.6 acres divided into 5 small blocks, each of which are planted with different Pinot Noir clones or field selection. Clone 115, 667 and 777 dark pigments and rich structure, and pure aromas, and the Calera selection comes from cuttings from a true Burgundian clone form Josh Jenson’s Mt Harlan Vineyard, as well as another selection from DRC which offer more seductive complexities.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2016 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Carsi Vineyard lies about thirteen miles south of the winery in a wide flat basin just north of the town of Napa.  It's a cooler zone of heavier soils where Chardonnay does exceptionally well. V. Sattui purchased the land in 1989 and invested heavily in soil amendments fertilization and trellising of the existing vines before naming it after my great-grandfather Vittorio's Italian village in the mountains above Genoa.  We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time. Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into 100% new French oak barrels for fermentation. We typically divide the Chardonnay from this vineyard into four different lots; three of them will be inoculated with a different yeast strain; each one capable of producing different aromatic compounds while one lot will undergo a native fermentation with no yeast addition. Once primary fermentation has been completed, winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation, also referred to as secondary fermentation. The completion of malolactic fermentation will aid in providing a creamier texture with a fuller mouthfeel. All lots are stirred biweekly through malolactic, and will age on its lees for ten months until racked out for blending and bottling.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2016 Los Carneros Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our Los Carneros Chardonnay is an exquisite compilation of select vineyards throughout the AVA, each site bringing a certain nuance to the finalized blend. The cool climate in Carneros makes it ideal for growing Chardonnay grapes, and this wine is here to prove it. The grapes come from our own historic Hibbard Ranch property, as well as renowned Chardonnay source, Huichica Vineyard, also in Los Carneros.Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF.

        <title>2016 Los Carneros Pinot Noir - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2016 Los Carneros Pinot Noir is a glorious representation of this world renowned viticultural area. The fruit for this wine comes from our estate vineyard, Henry Ranch, located along Carneros Creek and adjacent to the Mt. Veeder AVA. It is planted to four different clones, Dijon selections 115 and 777, clone 828 and Pommard clone 5, all grafted to 44-53 rootstocks on a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system. The VSP trellis forces clusters to the outside of the canopy, to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions. Summer average temperatures range from 50 to 90 F which makes it ideal site for these varietals. Cool summer nights retain the acidity and hot days bring the maturity to perfection.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel tank where peak temperature is typically 92ºF; and the yeast strain is RC212. The wine is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the skins and seeds.For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin content. Once these are at an optimum in the wine we drain the free-run juice from the skins to another tank and keep separate the hard press wine, which will be evaluated and aged separately. Once the new wine has settled in tank (3-4 days) we rack off the gross grape solids (lees) and move to barrels. The 2nd fermentation (called Malolactic) will then proceed in small barrels over several months.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2016 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench”. Gary is a third-generation farmer on this property a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained gravelly soils which produce fine-grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grapes to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <description>The rugged mountain elevations and complex marine soils of the Mt. Veeder appellation allows the fruit to mature slowly in the Estate property developing incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time. We have three clones of Cabernet planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock selections and spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.</description>

        <description>This beautiful Bordeaux blend uses all five of the classic Bordeaux grape varieties bringing the flavors and characters of the individual grapes into a fabulous expression of cellar-worthy Cabernet Sauvignon wine. It is loaded with black cherry aromas black pepper spice and rich blackcurrant and jammy notes and tannin structure from the Cabernet. The red berry fruit and round ripe plum and cocoa from the Merlot are joined with the assertive earthy tones of Malbec minerals and graphite/pencil lead and cedar from Petite Verdot and savory aromatic herbs and hazelnut from the Cabernet Franc. Together they make a truly remarkable and unique red blend worthy of the best Napa Valley has to offer.Vintage Notes: Following the very small 2015 harvest it was heartening to see the vines recover and bounce back to produce not only extremely high quality fruit but also some bounty in 2016! Harvest was earlier than we expected and we observed optimum flavor and phenolic development progress as we harvested. With the ample rain that fell this past spring the soils were moist and the vines started growing in early spring and shoot growth was active. Flowering also turned out be optimum with very little frost so the individual grape varieties responded and good pollination allowed for a more typical crop.  Across the board the flavors and acids were exceptional; very fresh fruit aromas and flavors were evident in the whites and a delicious balance evolved as the harvest proceeded. Acids are firm and pH is slightly lower so the wines should be well-structured with very good aging potential. During harvest we saw the reds evolve every day as the skins softened the tannins became more velvety and the grapes came into their own. This is an exciting vintage with a lot to like!</description>

        <title>2016 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Following the very small 2015 harvest it was heartening to see the vines recover and bounce back to produce not only extremely high quality fruit but also some bounty in 2016!Vineyard Notes:The Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity.  The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest. (Limit: 6 per person)</description>

        <title>2016 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon - Double Magnum</title>
        <description>Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton Loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.</description>

        <description>Each sip is delightfully balanced with a refreshing acidity and a hint of natural sweetness accompanied by its subtle creamy texture and effervescence.Vineyard Notes: Our 2017 Blanc de Noir is made from 100% Pinot Noir grapes that were grown from our Estate Vineyard “Boonville Ranch” in Anderson Valley Mendocino County. This appellation is ideal for producing high quality sparkling wines because of it’s proximately to the Pacific Ocean. The cool coastal climate allows the grapes to ripen slowly and retain their acidity levels an essential quality needed for sparkling wines.</description>

        <title>2017 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Carsi Vineyard lies about thirteen miles south of the winery in a wide flat basin just north of the town of Napa. It's a cooler zone of heavier soils where Chardonnay does exceptionally well. V. Sattui purchased the land in 1989 and invested heavily in soil amendments fertilization and trellising of the existing vines before naming it after my great-grandfather Vittorio's Italian village in the mountains above Genoa. We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time.Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into 100% French oak barrels for fermentation. We typically divide the Chardonnay from this vineyard into four different lots; three of them will be inoculated with a different yeast strain; each one capable of producing different aromatic compounds while one lot will undergo a native fermentation with no yeast addition. Once primary fermentation has been completed, winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation, also referred to as secondary fermentation. The completion of malolactic fermentation will aid in providing a creamier texture with a fuller mouthfeel. All lots are stirred biweekly through malolactic and will age on its lees for ten months until racked out for blending and bottling.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2017 Los Carneros Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Our 2017 Los Carneros Chardonnay was crafted with fruit from our estate vineyard, Hibbard Ranch in Los Carneros. This cool appellation overlooks the San Pablo Bay, where summer average temperatures range from 50º to 90ºF, making it an ideal site for Burgundian varietals. The cool summer nights allow the fruit to retain its acidity while warmer days bring the maturity to perfection. These vines are farmed utilizing a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system, which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold.

        <title>2017 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench” below Mt. St. John in the Mayacamas range. Gary is a third-generation farmer in a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained Bale Clay Loam gravelly soils producing fine- grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-West by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993.(Limit: 1 per person)</description>

        <title>2017 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>The 2017 wine quality shows a lot of bright acidity and fresh varietal aromas in the white wines and deep color sweet fruit flavors and firm tannin structure in the reds. Yields were good with a few varieties being a bit above average and some below historical production. Vineyard Notes:Located in the rugged Mayacamas Mountains at elevations ranging from 1250-1400 ft. our Mt. Veeder Estate is situated in a unique microclimate offering cooler temperatures during the day with warmer temperatures at night. Planted on ancient marine soils the fruit in this vineyard develops slowly and steadily until full phenolic ripeness is reached. Often the very last of our vineyards to be harvested; our Mt. Veeder Estate offers small yields of deeply pigmented intensely flavored fruit which produce wines of complexity power and elegance that speak to their provenance year after year.(Limit: 2 per person)</description>

        <title>2017 Rutherford Dust Up Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>With only a few hundred cases produced we are thrilled to introduce this new release small-batch special bottling of Cabernet Sauvignon. The coveted fruit used to make this wine was grown on the world-famous Rutherford Bench by third generation Napa Valley grape growers and brothers Mike and Gary Morisoli whose family planted grapes in western Rutherford in the early 1950's. This an area of well-drained alluvial soils below Mt. St. John that produce fine-grain “dusty” and supple tannins where some of the most notable Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. It is a tribute to their family’s hard work and dedication to growing the finest grapes in Napa Valley.Winter of 2017 provided record-breaking rainfall - a welcome end to the 4-years of drought. In late spring bloom and fruit set in May occurred under ideal conditions – no frost no rain and no winds to interfere with pollination; just warm sunshine. Summer was warmer than normal but the vines weathered the heat well and maturity moved along at a steady pace. A short but intense heat wave during the first part of September brought brix levels up dramatically so winemakers needed to be patient waiting for the pH acids flavor and color development in the grapes to catch up to sugar accumulation before harvesting. The 2017 wine quality shows a lot of deep color sweet fruit flavors and firm tannin structure in the reds. Yields were good with a few varieties being a bit above average and some below historical production. When the awful and destructive fires that ravaged portions of the wine country in mid-October occurred only a very small portion of the 2017 crop remained on the vines at the start of the fires and we harvested them quickly anticipating a negligible impact from the fires on wine quality.</description>

        <title>2017 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather, who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’, and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained, gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity, and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.</description>

        <title>2018 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay - Magnum</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Carsi Vineyard lies about thirteen miles south of the winery in a wide flat basin just north of the town of Napa. It's a cooler zone of heavier soils where Chardonnay does exceptionally well. V. Sattui purchased the land in 1989 and invested heavily in soil amendments fertilization and trellising of the existing vines before naming it after my great-grandfather Vittorio's Italian village in the mountains above Genoa. We began to produce some excellent Chardonnays in just a short time.Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks, where it settles for 24 hours at 50ºF. Once the gross grape solids (lees) have settled, the clear juice is then racked into 100% new French oak barrels for fermentation. We typically divide the Chardonnay from this vineyard into four different lots; three of them will be inoculated with a different yeast strain; each one capable of producing different aromatic compounds while one lot will undergo a native fermentation with no yeast addition. Once primary fermentation has been completed, winemaking will determine which lots will go through malolactic fermentation, also referred to as secondary fermentation. The completion of malolactic fermentation will aid in providing a creamier texture with a fuller mouthfeel. All lots are stirred biweekly through malolactic, and will age on its lees for ten months until racked out for blending and bottling.1.5L Magnum: Equivalent to two standard 750ml bottles. Serves 6-8 people.</description>

        <title>2018 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench” below Mt. St. John in the Mayacamas range. Gary is a third-generation farmer in a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained Bale Clay Loam gravelly soils producing fine- grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-west by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993. </description>

        <description>Vineyard Notes:For our Prestige Cuvée Brut Rosé we used a blend of 84% Pinot Noir and 16% Chardonnay from grapes grown from our estate vineyards along the North Coast. This appellation is the perfect climate for producing high quality sparkling wines because of the cooling influence of the Pacific Ocean. The moderate, coastal climate allows the grapes to ripen slowly and retain their acidity levels, an essential quality needed for sparkling wines.</description>

        <title>2018 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa known for its gravelly soils which produce rich alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity. The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.</description>

        <title>2018 Rutherford Dust Up Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This very limited and special bottling of Cabernet Sauvignon comes from a blend of Gary Morisoli’s vineyard on Niebaum Lane and Mike Morisoli’s vineyard, just a stone’s throw away. Mike and Gary are 3rd generation Napa Valley grape growers, beginning with the Morisoli Family planted grapes in western Rutherford in early 1950’s. The vineyards are located in the heart of the famous “Rutherford Bench”, an area of well-drained, alluvial soils below Mt. St. John that produce fine-grain “dusty” and supple tannins and where some of the most notable Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. It is a tribute to their family’s hard work and dedication to growing the finest grapes in Napa Valley.Winemaking Notes: The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. They are “de-stemmed”, berry sorted and crushed to tank. The initial “cold-soak” (no fermentation) of the grapes is 3-4 days at 50ºF. Multiple lots were fermented in stainless steel, with a small amount in 60-gallon barrels for “barrel-fermentation”; tank peak temperature is typically 92ºF; and the yeast strain is Premier Cuvee. The wine is tasted twice a day to evaluate the color and tannin extraction from the skins and seeds.For this wine we are looking for a careful balance of deep red pigment intensity, complexity of flavors and balance in the mid-palate, and overall tannin content. Once these are at an optimum in the wine, we drain the free-run juice from the skins to another tank and keep separate the hard press wine, which will be evaluated and aged separately. Once the new wine has settled in tank (3-4 days) we rack off the gross grape solids (lees) and move to barrels. The 2nd fermentation (called Malolactic) will then proceed in small barrels over several months.</description>

        <title>2018 Vangone Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (magnum)</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Vangone Vineyard is located on the bench land above a steep cliff on the east side of the Napa Valley, 1200 feet above the valley floor. This unique vineyard site features gravelly, volcanic soils and a southwestern facing sun exposure. To match site and soil conditions, Cabernet clones 191m 4 and 169 were densely planted on 6’ x 4’ spacing to ensure ideal terroir for top quality Mountain Cabernet.Winemaking Notes:The grapes are harvested at night into ½ ton bins, arriving at the winery early morning and very cold.

        <title>2018 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.</description>

        <title>2019 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench” below Mt. St. John in the Mayacamas range. Gary is a third-generation farmer in a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained Bale Clay Loam gravelly soils producing fine- grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-west by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993. </description>

        <title>2019 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The rugged mountain elevations have complex marine Franciscan Formation soils with metamorphosed marine sediments such as Haire loam Cole silt loam Fagan clay loam and Felton gravelly loam with small amounts of more recent Sonoma Volcanic soils. The cool Mt. Veeder appellation overlooking the San Pablo Bay allows the fruit to mature slowly developing incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time of the grapes. We have Cabernet clones 4 7 337 and 191 planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock. The vines are spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.

        <title>2019 Paradiso</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Paradiso is the proprietary name for our red “Meritage” - a Bordeaux-style blend that changes in varietal composition from vintage to vintage. In an homage to this type of wine, we have included five of classic grape varietals, with no single variety making up more than 90% of the blend. The beauty of this is that no one varietal stands out, but that each one is harmoniously balanced by the others. These wines are prized for the smooth, silky textures and complex, full-bodied structure. They age beautifully for decades; however, most are also very drinkable in their younger years.</description>

        <title>2019 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation, where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa, known for its gravelly soils which produce rich, alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity. The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old, 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy, or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.

        <title>2020 Cara Chardonnay</title>
        <description>&quot;With this special bottling of Chardonnay I dedicate this wine to my wife Cara.  Like Katarina before her Cara is a very strong forthright determined and loving woman. Cara and I met as co-workers here at V. Sattui Winery 41 years ago and two years later we were married!  I marvel and celebrate strong women that balance family work and community and that is the inspiration behind the naming of this wine!&quot; - V. Sattui Winery President Tom DaviesVineyard Notes:Our 2020 Cara Chardonnay is a unique blend of fruit sourced from our estate properties Hibbard Ranch (32%) in Los Carneros and Carsi Vineyard (68%) in Yountville. These properties are located toward the cool southern end of Napa Valley where fog from the San Pablo Bay helps regulate temperature throughout the growing season. The coastal influence of the bay keeps daytime temperatures cool allowing grapes to develop slowly ripen evenly and develop full varietal flavors.</description>

        <description>Vineyard NotesThe Duarte Vineyard consists of two small Zinfandel blocks one planted in 1981 and the other in 2014 to 5BB rootstock. It is dry farmed in most years and the soils are very sandy and extremely well-drained. The warmer summer temperatures are moderated with strong and cooling breezes from the bay to create the perfect growing conditions for these vines.</description>

        <title>2020 Entanglement (gsm)</title>
        <description>Vineyards Notes: Our Entanglement is a delightful blend featuring Grenache, Syrah and Mourvédre (GSM). Our Grenache and Syrah are sourced from our Carsi Vineyard estate located in Yountville. This 27-acre vineyard was named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace, the Italian hillside village of Carsi. Yountville has a combination of soil types and micro climates that make this location perfect for growing different varietals. Our Mourvédre comes from Vittorio’s Vineyard located at our estate in St Helena, where only half an acre is planted. Last, but certainly not least we incorporate a touch of our Petite Sirah, which adds a dash of its characteristic rich, purple color, and recognizably deep fruity flavor.</description>

        <title>2020 Napa Valley Grenache</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2020 Napa Valley Grenache utilizes fruit sourced completely from our own estate ranch Carsi Vineyard in Yountville. While this wine is made of predominantly Grenache, we sought to blend in just a touch of Syrah, which lends some dark fruit and slightly peppery characteristics. Our vines are spaced at 7ft. between the rows and 4ft. between the vines and row direction is generally North-South on a v. vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system. This arrangement forces grape clusters to the outside of the canopy, to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.</description>

        <title>2020 Pilgrim Vineyard Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Pilgrim Vineyard is a 12-acre parcel located in the Lodi AVA, which lies just between Sacramento and Stockton, extending east until it runs into the Sierra Foothills AVA. This lovely vineyard is owned by Joel and Martine Herche, who after moving sixteen times in sixteen years, ended their pilgrimage in 1998 by finally settling down on this vineyard. They playfully named it for John Bunyan’s work, “The Pilgrim’s Progress”. The vines are certified to be at least 70 years old, but are reputed to be much older and are flourishing.

        <title>2020 Reserve Stock Chardonnay Napa Valley</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2020 Reserve Stock Chardonnay is crafted to reflect the premier quality of our estate grown Chardonnay, with a bold accompaniment of rich toasted oak that has been imparted over the nine months of sur-lees barrel aging in 100% New French Oak. For this vintage, about 50% of the blend is composed of fruit sourced from Hibbard Ranch in Los Carneros, 38% from Carsi Vineyard in Yountville, and the remaining 12% from Collina d’ Oro Vineyard in the Russian River Valley of Sonoma County. These three appellations are well-known throughout both Napa and Sonoma Counties for producing the highest quality Chardonnay, and this wine is here to prove it!</description>

        <description>Vineyard Notes:John Murrill’s Zinfandel vines at Amador Ridge Vineyard are located just outside of Sutter Creek on an ancient mud-slide of red cobbly-loam soil. The head-trained Zinfandel is grafted to St. George rootstock on an east-facing slope allowing him to dry-farm in most seasons and to irrigate the vines only in exceptionally dry years. John practices sustainable farming and yield are only 2 to 2 ½ tons per acre on average.</description>

        <title>2021 Black-sears Zinfandel (howell Mountain)</title>
        <description>Vineyard NotesBlack-Sears Vineyard, located in the Howell Mountain sub-appellation of Napa Valley, is one of the most prestigious hillsides in the AVA. It was planted in 1975 and at an elevation of 2400 ft., is one of the highest vineyards in Napa County. Influenced by the local topography, temperature variation is high here, as the vineyard sits above the fog line that serves as a climate moderator to the valley below. Grapes bask in the sunshine by day allowing them to develop intense color and flavor but cool down overnight allowing them to retain their acidity and structure. The soil types here are also influenced by topography, and tend to be very thin, dry, and lacking in nutrients; long been considered conducive to quality fruit production as vines produced smaller more intensely flavored fruit with bountiful tannin structure and excellent aging potential.</description>

        <title>2021 Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our Carsi Vineyard Chardonnay showcases fruit solely from our 27-acre estate vineyard, named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace, the Italian hillside village of Carsi. There are three Chardonnay blocks each planted to showcase a unique clone of Chardonnay. Clones 95 and 76 are Dijon clones which are lower yielding, with small clusters and concentrated flavors, while clone 809 characteristically has a more floral aroma. These Chardonnay vines were planted in 1999 on a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system, which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy, to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions. Summer average temperatures range from 50º to 90ºF which makes it ideal site for these varietals. Cool summer nights retain the acidity and hot days bring the maturity to perfection.</description>

        <description>Vineyard NotesThe Collins Family, Block 20 Zinfandel was planted in 1923 on an alluvial fan on the north end of the St. Helena Appellation and is adjacent to the Historic Bale Gristmill. The traditional head-trained vines are grafted to St. George rootstock and this years’ harvest marks the vines 96th birthday! The yields average less than 3 tons per acre, and the soil is very well-drained with lots of large stones and gravel that has been washed down from the steep Mayacamas Mountain Range to the West.</description>

        <title>2021 Entanglement (gsm)</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:A majority of the blend (50%) comes from Hibbard Ranch in Los Carneros. This appellation lies on the border of both Napa and Sonoma Counties, but unlike other cool-climate AVA’s in Sonoma County, Los Carneros receives much less rainfall, and it is farther from the ocean. The area’s dense, clay soils are not particularly deep or fertile, and these factors when combined produce fruit with concentrated flavors.We also source grapes for this wine from just down the road at our other estate property, Carsi Vineyard (40%) located in Yountville. It is a 27-acre vineyard named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace, the Italian hillside village of Carsi. This appellation is one of the coolest wine growing regions in Napa Valley, which contributes to a long growing season and full-flavored fruit.The remainder of the blend (10%) comes from Vittorio’s Vineyard located at our estate in St Helena, and is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather, who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012. The Quantum Entanglements of Wine A certain magic occurs when combining three distinct varietals before fermentation as compared to after fermentation. This very magic occurs in the production of our newly released and oh-so-delicious 2012 Entanglement (GSM); a Rhone-style blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre.  Winery President Tom Davies and his friend and Professor of Physics at UCLA, Seth Putterman brainstormed on how to name this new Sattui wine and were inspired by Einstein’s discovery of  Quantum Entanglement which Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.”  Entanglement is the basis of quantum computing which in 15 years will give us computers where 35quantum bits equal today’s terabit. Entanglement occurs when the measurement of one particle affects the state of another particle that can even be far away. “What an appropriate name for a complex wine where each wonderful sip tastes teasingly different,” notes Putterman.  Each varietal dynamically interacts to create something all-together new and exciting. </description>

        <title>2021 Gilsson Vineyard Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Gilsson Vineyard is located along the Eastern section of the Russian River Valley Appellation in Sonoma County. The vines were planted in the early 1960s to St. George rootstock and are head-trained and spur-pruned. The soil consists of old, weathered “Laughlin Series” clay loam. The nutrients from these soils are tightly bound to microscopic clay particles and thus are not readily available which makes the vines work harder for survival. This struggle translates to a lower fruit production per vine, but higher quality grapes with concentrated flavors.</description>

        <title>2021 La Merica</title>
        <description>About La Merica: Our 2021 La Merica celebrates and honors our winery’s Italian heritage with a modern interpretation of a classic pre-prohibition blend. Though proprietary by nature this wine is largely composed from grape varietals sourced from our estate vineyards Carsi Vineyard and Hibbard Ranch. The star players in this powerhouse blend are some of the key Rhone varietals like Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Grenache along with a few unlikely candidates mixed in to spice things up!“I wanted to make a wine that celebrated and honored our winery’s Italian heritage with a modern interpretation of a classic pre-prohibition blend.   For over 150 years in California, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel have been planted side-by-side and are natural blending partners – with Petite Sirah providing the color, spice, and structure, and Zinfandel contributing its varietal distinctive dark berry fruit and aromas.  Our new-world blend takes these classic grapes and steers away from the rustic old-world style and boldly produces a wine filled with deeply dark-fruited flavors inky-purple color and supple and lingering textures.In searching for name for this special wine I came across a paper given to me by Dr. Victor Geraci a noted wine historian and professor at UC Berkeley during our 125th Anniversary of V. Sattui in 2010.   In his paper he spoke of the mass Italian immigration of the late 1800s and early 1900s with many of these immigrants finding a home and work in the nascent California winegrowing business.  In the dialect of their native tongue they affectionately referred to their new home in America as La Merica.La Merica honors these brave men, women, and children that left a home filled with poverty and political hardship to a new home filled with hope and opportunity.  I want this wine to embrace the importance of immigration not only as the foundation and building blocks of our great country but also for our future and continued greatness as a nation of immigrants.  La Merica rejoices everything that is great about America: Freedom, Transparency, Opportunity, Choice, Due Process, Acceptance, and Diversity.”  – V. Sattui President Tom Davies</description>

        <title>2021 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:This wine comes from Gary &amp; Melody Morisoli’s Vineyard located in the heart of the famed “Rutherford Bench” below Mt. St. John in the Mayacamas range. Gary is a third-generation farmer in a special part of Napa Valley known for well-drained Bale Clay Loam gravelly soils producing fine- grain supple tannins in the wine and where some of the best Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. The vine rows are oriented on a direction that is slightly North-west by South-East with a “V-trellis” that allows optimum filtered light to hit the ripening grape clusters. Clone 7 Cabernet Sauvignon is grafted to 110R rootstock on this very cobbly and rocky ground. Gary typically uses very limited irrigation during the growing season essentially dry-farming in most years. The vines were planted in 1990 and V. Sattui has been harvesting these grape to make a single-vineyard designate since the first small harvest of 1993. </description>

        <title>2021 Mt. Veeder Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The rugged mountain elevations have complex marine Franciscan Formation soils with metamorphosed marine sediments such as Haire loam Cole silt loam Fagan clay loam and Felton gravelly loam with small amounts of more recent Sonoma Volcanic soils. The cool Mt. Veeder appellation overlooking the San Pablo Bay allows the fruit to mature slowly developing incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time of the grapes. We have Cabernet clones 4, 7, 337, and 191 planted to these steep hills grafted to 1103P and 101-14 rootstock. The vines are spaced at 9 ft. between rows and 4 ft. between vines. Row direction is generally North-South on a vertical trellis system. This area has the longest growing season and the lowest yields in Napa Valley and in most years it is last cabernet harvested for V. Sattui.</description>

        <title>2021 Napa Valley Chardonnay</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Our 2021 Napa Valley Chardonnay is made from a delightful blend of our estate vineyard fruit. A majority of which comes from Hibbard Ranch (68%) located in Los Carneros. This appellation lies on the border of both Napa and Sonoma Counties, but unlike other cool-climate AVA’s in Sonoma County, Los Carneros receives much less rainfall, and it is farther from the ocean. The area’s dense, clay soils are not particularly deep or fertile, and these factors when combined create a powerful Chardonnay with concentrated fruit flavors.We also chose to incorporate a touch of the fruit (18%) from Carsi Vineyard, just down the road in Yountville. It is a 27-acre vineyard named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace, the Italian hillside village of Carsi. This appellation is one of the coolest wine growing regions in Napa Valley, which contributes to a long growing season and full-flavored fruit.A small component of the final blend (14%) also includes fruit from our Russian River Valley Estate “Collina d’Oro. This climate promotes full flavor maturity over an extended growing season, while allowing the fruit to retain its natural acidity. The combination of fractured sandstone and sandy loam soils allow the vineyards to retain water and heat, which help to produce smooth, round wines with less acidity that are highly aromatic.</description>

        <title>2021 Napa Valley Grenache</title>
        <description>Vineyard NotesThe grapes for our 2021 Napa Valley Grenache are sourced completely from our own estate ranches. A majority (73%) of the blend comes from Carsi Vineyard located in Yountville. It is a 27-acre vineyard named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace, the Italian hillside village of Carsi. This appellation is one of the coolest wine growing regions in Napa Valley, which contributes to a long growing season and full-flavored fruit.The remainder of the blend (27%) is sourced from just down the road at Hibbard Ranch in Los Carneros. This appellation lies on the border of both Napa and Sonoma Counties, but unlike other cool-climate AVA’s in Sonoma County, Los Carneros receives much less rainfall, and it is farther from the ocean.

        <title>2021 Napa Valley Malbec</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2021 Napa Valley Malbec sources grapes from our estate vineyard located in Yountville. It is a 27-acre vineyard named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace, the Italian hillside village of Carsi. Yountville has a combination of soil types and micro climates that make this location perfect for growing different varietals. We’ve selected Malbec clone 595, which is praised for its intense dark color and pronounced fruit characteristics reflected in both the aroma and palate of its wines. These vines were planted in 2010, on a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system, which forces fruit clusters to the outside of the canopy in order to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance their ripening. Summer average temperatures range from 50ºF to 90ºF which makes it ideal site for these varietals.  Cool summer nights retain the acidity and hot days bring the maturity to perfection</description>

        <title>2021 Napa Valley Petite Sirah</title>
        <description>Vineyard NotesThere
is no doubt that our Petite Sirah is here to make a statement. It is bursting
with ripe fruit character, reflective of the grapes that were sourced from some
of our favorite vineyards:  Oles Vineyard
in St. Helena AVA, Allias Vineyard located in Rutherford, and Mounts Vineyard
over in Dry Creek Valley.  Though these
vineyards are found in different viticultural regions, they are all optimally
located near coastal mountain ranges which serve as a conduit for the cool
costal air and fog to come in at night. While long, warm days allow for the
fruit to fully ripen, the evenings allow grapes to mature slowly and retain the
perfect acidity and balance.</description>

        <title>2021 Napa Valley Syrah</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2021 Napa Valley Syrah utilizes four different clones that are grown in three different appellations throughout Napa Valley. With careful consideration we’ve planted each clone in its optimal climate so that our finished wine displays beautiful aromatics with rich full-bodied complexity and strong tannin structure.Vittorio’s Vineyard (clones 470 and 383) in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years.Just down the road in Yountville at Carsi Vineyard (clone 174) named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace- the Italian hillside village of Carsi there is a combination of soil types and microclimates that make this location perfect for growing different varietals.Last but certainly not least we have a single acre of Syrah planted at our estate ranch in Mt. Veeder (clone 877) where the San Pablo Bay allows the fruit to mature slowly developing incredibly deep red color and rich concentration of flavors with the extended hang-time of the grapes.</description>

        <title>2021 Prestige Cuvée Brut</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:For our 2021 Prestige Cuvée Brut we used a blend of 77% Chardonnay and 23% Pinot Noir from grapes that were grown in Napa Valley. This appellation is the perfect climate for producing high quality sparkling wines because of the cooling influence of the San Francisco Bay. The moderate coastal climate allows the grapes to ripen slowly and retain their acidity levels an essential quality needed for sparkling wines. Winemaking Notes: The grapes are hand-harvested at night into ½ ton bins arriving at the winery early morning and very cold. Whole clusters are pressed and the “free run juice” is separated from the “press juice”. The juice is transferred to stainless steel tanks. After primary fermentation the resulting wine is “bone dry” (no residual grape sugar) then the “Tirage” bottling occurs where it undergoes the secondary fermentation in the bottle following the French “Method Champenoise”. Following the aging process bottles are transferred into riddling bins where they undergo a month long process of slight turns which gradually move the yeast lees to the cork. Once completed the bottles undergo the disgorging process where they are inverted the necks frozen to ensure the sediment is removed and then finished with the cork and packaging. At this point the champagne is ready to be enjoyed!</description>

        <title>2021 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:The Preston Vineyard is located in the Rutherford Appellation, where some of the finest Cabernet Sauvignon in Napa Valley is grown. This was one of the first cabernet vineyards that Dario Sattui was drawn to in the early years. It is a very small region of Napa, known for its gravelly soils which produce rich, alluring and opulent red wines with fine-grained tannins and incredible complexity. The alluvial soils from Mount St. John have washed down from the hills over millennia to create a unique layering of weathered rock and gravel mixed with clay. The vines are 40-plus years old, 10’ X 8’ spacing and trained to a divided canopy, or “Quad”. The trellis allows ample light penetration on the fruit creating perfect flavor development and excellent maturity in the grapes at harvest.

        <description>Vineyard Notes:Tiny Quaglia (Italian for “quail”) Vineyard is actually two separate parcels in St. Helena about a mile apart. One parcel is on Spring Street on the west side of town; the other is on Pratt Avenue just north of town. When Ray Quaglia's forefathers acquired this land in the early 1930’s it had already been farmed for fifty years by the Valley's early Italian growers. Back in the day it was customary to plant &quot;field blends&quot;; different grape varieties alongside each other, which when picked altogether produced the blend that was desired in the bottle. Most of the vines are Zinfandel but there are varying amounts of Petite Sirah and Carignane throughout the vineyard as well for added color and flavor complexity.</description>

        <title>2021 Ramazzotti Vineyard Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: The head-trained vines from Ramazzotti Vineyard, located in Sonoma County’s Dry Creek Valley, were planted in 1982 from the Mazzoni clone, thought to be one of the original heritage clones dating back to the mid- 19th century. It is on a southwest-facing slope above the fog line, allowing the afternoon sun to fully ripen the grapes. Its shallow soil and an impenetrable layer of rock below naturally balance the vines, so they’ve never overproduce. Although the yields per acre were minuscule, the resulting wines are expansive works of art.</description>

        <title>2021 Russian River Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes The Russian River Valley is strongly influenced by two key factors: weather and geology. The coastal influence from the Pacific Ocean moderates the temperatures as much as 35 to 40 degrees from its daytime high. This climate promotes full flavor maturity over an extended growing season, while allowing the fruit to retain its natural acidity. The combination of fractured sandstone and sandy loam soils allow the vineyards to retain water and heat, which help to produce smooth, round wines with less acidity that are highly aromatic. </description>

        <title>2021 School House Creek Zinfandel</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:To combat the loss of heritage vineyards in the California, is to buy them.  Fortunately, we were given this opportunity in 2023 when we became the new owners of School House Creek Vineyard, a 13.5 acre, dry-farmed vineyard mostly planted in the early 70s, with a smaller portion dating back to the 1950s.

The vineyard is located 800 feet above Dry Creek Road, about 12 miles to the west from Healdsburg in Sonoma County.  Its south-facing slopes give the old vines all day sun; while it’s natural, head-pruning provides a healthy canopy that shades the berries from the direct sunlight.  These old vines have never been irrigated and rely on an underground creek (School House Creek) located over 20 feet below ground level.

We are honored and privileged to be the stewards of this heritage vineyard; and proud that in a small way, we are doing our part to save California Zinfandel. The vines were planted in 1972 to St. George rootstock and are head-trained at 10’ by 8’ spacing. The soils consist of weathered gravelly loam on a well-drained alluvial bench above the valley floor. They are “dry-farmed”, meaning grown without irrigation, which limits vine growth but intensifies the flavor.

        <title>2021 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Vittorio’s Vineyard in St. Helena is named in honor of Dario Sattui’s great-grandfather who founded the original V. Sattui Winery in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood in 1885. Its Pleasanton Loam soils are derived from meanderings of an ancient stream which laid down layers of gravel and silt loams over thousands of years. The vines are spaced at 7’ x 5’ and rows are slightly north of east-west and grown to a VSP trellis. These well-drained gravelly soils promote early-ripening and optimum maturity and they are often the first Cabernet grapes of the harvest. Vittorio’s Vineyard has been farmed organically since 2009 and was certified as “Organically- Farmed” by the CCOF in 2012.</description>

        <title>2022 Another World Pinot Noir</title>
        <description>Same gorgeous wine... new name!Wine is of a place. The wines we have created from Boonville and the Anderson Valley are singular and reflect the terroir, its beauty, and stunning landscapes. These wines also reflect a place that seems a world away from Napa and the Bay Area. It is fitting that we have renamed our Boonville Vineyard to Another World Vineyard, a name that captures the uniqueness and beauty of this gorgeous place on earth. The vineyard is located just on the outskirts of the small, and quirky town of Boonville; Any town that has its own jargon called Boontling created in the late 1800s is deserving of being labeled as quirky. Visiting Anderson Valley is like being in Another World and is worth every twist and hairpin curve for 28 miles!  &quot;Bahl Hornin&quot;  (&quot;It's good drinkin&quot; in Boontling) is what we think of the wines from this special place.Vineyard Notes:The grapes for this wine are grown in Anderson Valley, which is only about 16 miles long and up to 1½ miles wide, surrounded on three sides by rolling hills and low mountains and open to the west through majestic old- and second-growth redwoods to the Pacific Ocean along the Navarro River. With the coastal influence keeping temperatures cool, grapes are allowed to develop slowly, ripen evenly, and develop their characteristically exotic flavors over time while preserving acidity. This vineyard is planted utilizing a VSP trellis system, which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy, to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.</description>

        <title>2022 Bacci Bianco</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes Our 2022 Bacci Bianco is made from a delightful blend of our estate vineyard fruit. A majority of which comes from Hibbard Ranch (82%) located in Los Carneros. This appellation lies on the border of both Napa and Sonoma Counties, but unlike other cool-climate AVA’s in Sonoma County, Los Carneros receives much less rainfall, and it is farther from the ocean. We also chose to incorporate a touch of fruit (18%) from our estate vineyard in Solano County.  This county lies just South of Napa County, and is known for its alluvial soils, deposited on the flat valley floors over many years by rivers running through the area.  Solano County enjoys a maritime climate due to the close proximity of the Sacramento Delta. Ocean breezes and fog from both Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay help to cool the vineyards, which extends the growing season and leads to grapes that produce balanced wines with good acidity and phenolic ripeness. </description>

        <title>2022 Dry Riesling</title>
        <description>Vineyard NotesOur 2022 Mt. Veeder Dry Riesling was produced from a single vineyard block located at our estate property Hibbard Ranch. While a section of this estate falls in the Los Carneros designated appellation a small portion of our upper blocks are in the separate sub-appellation of Mt. Veeder which lies above the fog line. The rugged mountain elevations have complex marine Franciscan Formation soils with metamorphosed marine sediments such as Haire loam Cole silt loam Fagan clay loam and Felton gravelly loam with small amounts of more recent Sonoma Volcanic soils. The cool Mt. Veeder appellation overlooking the San Pablo Bay allows the fruit to mature slowly developing incredibly rich concentrated flavors with the extended hang-time of the grapes. </description>

        <title>2022 Gamay Rouge</title>
        <description>About V. Sattui's Gamay Rouge Gamay is a grape variety predominantly grown in Burgundy, specifically in the Beaujolais region. Known for producing fruity, low-tannin, and easy-drinking wines, Gamay is often associated with Beaujolais Nouveau and Beaujolais-Villages wines.

At V. Sattui Winery, our Gamay Rouge is crafted from the Valdiguié grape, introduced to California in the 1970s and initially misnamed as Napa Gamay due to its similar wine style to true Gamay from Beaujolais. Valdiguié, originating from southwestern France, gained popularity in California for producing wines reminiscent of Beaujolais, which were trendy at the time.

With regulations now preventing the use of the Napa Gamay name, we have trademarked Gamay Rouge as our proprietary name. This allows us to honor the grape's history and its unique Californian adaptation while continuing to offer a distinctive, enjoyable wine experience.Vineyard Notes:The Gamay Noir grapes we source for this bright refreshing wine are from our estate vineyard on Solano County. This varietal is most famous for producing the light, effervescent, fruit forward red wines of Beaujolais in eastern France. Characteristically these wines see no barrel aging at all and are enjoyed only weeks after harvest when they are fresh and vibrant. To honor tradition and pay homage to this varietal’s heritage we pick these grapes when they are lower in sugars and higher in acids to preserve the freshness and capture it in bottle to be enjoyed in any season.</description>

        <title>2022 Los Carneros Chardonnay</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes: Our 2022 Los Carneros Chardonnay was crafted using fruit from our estate vineyard, Hibbard Ranch in Los Carneros. This cool appellation overlooks the San Pablo Bay, where summer average temperatures range from 50º to 90ºF, making it an ideal site for Burgundian varietals. The cool summer nights allow the fruit to retain its acidity while warmer days bring the maturity to perfection. These vines are farmed utilizing a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system, which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.</description>

        <title>2022 Los Carneros Pinot Noir</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2022 Los Carneros Pinot Noir is a glorious representation of this world-renowned viticultural area. The fruit for this wine comes from our estate vineyard, Hibbard Ranch, located along Carneros Creek and adjacent to the Mt. Veeder AVA. It is planted to four different clones, Dijon selections 115 and 777, clone 828 and Pommard clone 5, all grafted to 44-53 rootstocks on a vertical shoot position (VSP) trellis system. The VSP trellis forces clusters to the outside of the canopy, to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions. Summer average temperatures range from 50ºF to 90ºF which makes it an ideal site for these varietals. Cool summer nights retain the acidity and hot days bring the maturity to perfection.</description>

        <title>2022 Muscat</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our highly unique 2022 Muscat is crafted from a blend of our estate grown grapes in Solono County. This county lies just South of Napa County, and is known for its alluvial soils, deposited on the flat valley floors over many years by rivers running through the area. Solano County enjoys a maritime climate due to the close proximity of the Sacramento Delta. Ocean breezes and fog from both Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay help to cool the vineyards, which extends the growing season and leads to grapes that produce balanced wines with good acidity and phenolic ripeness.</description>

        <title>2022 Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2022 Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc is a refreshing blend that showcases our estate vineyard fruit. A majority (55%) of the blend comes from Carsi Vineyard located in Yountville. It is a 27-acre vineyard named in honor of Vittorio Sattui’s birthplace, the Italian hillside village of Carsi. This appellation is one of the coolest wine growing regions in Napa Valley, which contributes to a long growing season and full-flavored fruit.The remainder of the blend (45%) is sourced from just down the road at Hibbard Ranch in Los Carneros. This appellation lies on the border of both Napa and Sonoma Counties, but unlike other cool-climate AVAs in Sonoma County, Los Carneros receives much less rainfall, and it is farther from the ocean. The area’s dense, clay soils are not particularly deep or fertile, and these factors when combined produce fruit with concentrated flavors.</description>

        <title>2022 Napa Valley Semillon</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Our 2022 Napa Valley Semillon sources fruit from two of our estate properties, Hibbard Ranch in Los Carneros (90%, Semillon) and Carsi Vineyard (10%, Sauvignon Blanc), located in the town of Yountville. With the coastal influence of the bay keeping temperatures cool, and chance of late-season rain minimal, grapes are allowed to develop slowly, ripen evenly, and develop fruit flavors over time while preserving acidity. These vineyards utilize a VSP trellis system for their vines, which forces clusters of fruit to the outside of the canopy to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance ripening under cool climate conditions.</description>

        <description>Vineyard NotesFor our 2022 Off-Dry Riesling, we decided that to best capture the essence of California, we would combine the grapes grown from our estate vineyard in Anderson Valley, with fruit from another well-known coastal climate Santa Barbara County. With the coastal influence keeping temperatures cool, grapes are allowed to develop slowly, ripen evenly, and develop their characteristically exotic flavors over time while preserving acidity. Both vineyards are planted utilizing a VSP trellis system, which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy, to increases their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.</description>

This region boasts a rare “transverse” geography, an east-west orientation that channels cool ocean air directly across the valley floor. The result is a Mediterranean-like climate that produces one of California’s longest growing regions. This unique environment ensures the grapes mature slowly, developing incredibly rich concentrated flavors with exquisite complexity and balance.</description>

        <title>2023 Another World Riesling</title>
        <description>Same gorgeous wine... new name!Wine is of a place.  The wines we have created from Boonville and the Anderson Valley are singular and reflect the terroir, its beauty, and stunning landscapes.  These wines also reflect a place that seems a world away from Napa and the Bay Area.  It is fitting that we have renamed our Boonville Vineyard to Another World Vineyard, a name that captures the uniqueness and beauty of this gorgeous place on earth.  The vineyard is located just on the outskirts of the small, and quirky town of Boonville;  Any town that has its own jargon called Boontling created in the late 1800s is deserving of being labeled as quirky.   Visiting Anderson Valley is like being in Another World and is worth every twist and hairpin curve for 28 miles!  &quot;Bahl Hornin&quot;  (&quot;It's good drinkin&quot; in Boontling) is what we think of the wines from this special place.Vineyard Notes:The grapes for this wine are grown in Anderson Valley, which is only about 16 miles long and up to 1½ miles wide, surrounded on three sides by rolling hills and low mountains and open to the west through majestic old- and second-growth redwoods to the Pacific Ocean along the Navarro River. With the coastal influence keeping temperatures cool, grapes are allowed to develop slowly, ripen evenly, and develop their characteristically exotic flavors over time while preserving acidity. This vineyard is planted utilizing a VSP trellis system, which forces clusters to the outside of the canopy, to increase their exposure to sunlight and enhance the ripening under cool climate conditions.</description>

        <title>2023 Moscato</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:While the translation of this wine from Italian to the English language may be simple, “Muscat Sparkling,” this wine is anything but simplistic. We crafted this sparkling, sweet delight from 75% of our estate grown Muscat while supplementing the remainder of the blend with fruit from one of our beloved growers in Anderson Valley. Fruit from both vineyard locations benefit from a transverse mountain range topography (East to West) with varying soil types, and a collage of microclimates that keep the regions cool. The chill of the fog and breezes from the ocean help extend the growing season, allowing the grapes to fully riper without excessive sugar levels- a key factor behind what makes this wine so elegant and unique. </description>

        <title>2023 Tre Uve Bianco</title>
        <description>Vineyard Notes:Tre Uve Bianco (Italian for “three white grapes”) is our newest addition to the V. Sattui family. This delightfully, refreshing white blend is the result of harmonizing three very exciting varietals into one wine: Chenin Blanc, Albariño, and Pinot Grigio. These are the newest grapes to be grown at our estate vineyard Hibbard Ranch in Los Carneros. This renowned growing region’s cool summer nights allow the fruit to retain its acidity while warmer days bring the maturity to perfection. </description>

        <title>Angelica</title>
        <description>Angelica is a fortified wine traditionally associated with the Mission grape from which it was made since the early days of California winemaking. V. Sattui instead uses the fresh juice of the Muscat of Alexandria grape and enhances it with brandy.Angelica is a full-bodied and elegant liqueur-like wine.  It's sweeter than most ports with a light amber to pale-salmon color and a smooth silky mouthfeel. We arrest the fermentation of the wine at an early stage with the addition of an almost 20-year-old pot-still brandy from Carneros causing the grapes to retain the maximum of their sugar content around 15% residual and an alcohol of about 18%. Store in a cool spot chill in the refrigerator just before opening and serve as an aperitif or dessert wine. After opening it will keep well in the refrigerator for weeks or months.</description>

        <title>Madeira</title>
        <description>Winemaking Notes:The solera process is an ingenious system of fractional blending perfected by the Spanish to ensure consistent quality based on the fact that old wines can be refreshed by the addition of a younger wine which then acquires the characteristics of the old wine. We begin with now what is now a 107-year-old vintage port, a lasting vestige from Vittorio Sattui's original winery as the mother (or master-blend). We then fashion primary secondary and tertiary blends &quot;criaderas&quot; using varying ages of Zinfandel - the oldest is more than 35 years old - and add a little back to the mother to keep it alive much like sourdough breadmaking. Over the years our Madeira has won a chest-full of Gold Medals and accolades. A noted wine columnist for the Times and Star in the U.K. Gerald Richardson wrote: “V. Sattui Madeira…is without a doubt the best Madeira in the world…”LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT MAKES OUR MADEIRA SPECIAL:HOW TO OPEN A BOTTLE OF MADEIRA:STORING MADEIRA:  Although our Madeira will age up to several years in perfect cellar conditions after being opened, we recommend it be consumed within 1-3 years after opening. Store it upright in our cupboard like you would a spirit.</description>
