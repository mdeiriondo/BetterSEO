        <title>2017 Estate Selection</title>
        <description>VINTAGE NOTES
A mild winter and spring advanced bud break at Crown Point, followed by only seven 100+ degree days. We classify 2017 as a warm vintage but not extremely hot, with a final heatwave at the end of October. Our nighttime temperatures were cooler, with lows in the 50s throughout September and October. As a result, the minimal days over 100 degrees allowed ripening to occur gradually, providing integrated, fine-grain tannin accumulation, and a consistent maturation.
WINEMAKER TASTING NOTES
The 2017 Crown Point Estate Selection is an engaging wine with notes of red fruit, strawberries, and vibrant floral tones of violets in harmony with toasted coffee notes. On the palate, the wine displays a gentle sweetness married with fine grain tannins, a velvety texture providing a long finish. A wine that can be appreciated now or for the next 20 years. </description>

        <title>2019 Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>VINTAGE2019 was a fascinating vintage at Crown Point, where we experienced a mild, wet winter with delayed flowering and harvest. A warmer summer followed with eleven days above 700 degrees from June through September, and ripening accelerated, providing an attractive sweetness to the wine. October offered a respite for the vines and extended hangtime with temperatures consistently in the 80s. While the summer heatwave marks the vintage, the cooler weather allowed the vines to recover and gracefully adapt. 
WINEMAKER NOTESThe wine offers profuse aromas of blackberry, cassis, and dark plum. Elegant notes of violets, white pepper, and rose petals follow, and together they deliver a very seductive bouquet. The seamlessly layered flavors build to a crescendo of fresh and juicy black fruit, accented with hints of orange zest, licorice, and dark chocolate. Beautifully balanced, the smooth round tannins and acidity deliver a long persistent finish.</description>

        <title>2019 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon</title>
        <description>VINTAGE2019 was a fascinating vintage at Crown Point, where we experienced a mild, wet winter with delayed flowering and harvest. A warmer summer followed with eleven days above 700 degrees from June through September, and ripening accelerated, providing an attractive sweetness to the wine. October offered a respite for the vines and extended hangtime with temperatures consistently in the 80s. While the summer heatwave marks the vintage, the cooler weather allowed the vines to recover and gracefully adapt.
WINEMAKER NOTESCrown Point's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon comprises the best barrel offerings, featuring block 3A, situated on the shallow clay soil mesa. Prior to selection, the wine aged for 22 months in new French oak barrels derived from the Allier Forest, which provide notes of freshly-roasted Geisha coffee and cinnamon. Emble&amp;shy;matic of Crown Point's terroir, the nose emanates loganberry, black currants, and fresh plums. The palate features layers of dark olives, violets, and savory herbs framed by a supple texture. This vintage was bottled unfined and unfiltered and will age remarkably for another 25 years.</description>

        <title>2022 Estate White</title>
        <description> 
We meticulously cultivate our Sauvignon Blanc grapes from a half-acre block in the southern portion of our estate vineyard. We begin by hand-picking the clusters into small containers, ensuring each grape is carefully selected. Upon arrival at the winery, we precisely sort the fruit before a gentle pressing. We employ a distinctive approach where each part of the pressing is allocated to its own barrel. We carefully settle, rack, and ferment each barrel separately, creating different wines from the same press lot.
Following fermentation, the wines are aged in barrels on lees for up to 8 months, imparting depth and complexity. We evaluate each barrel separately before the final blending. Our Estate White is then bottled, unfined, and unfiltered, preserving its character and reflecting the unique terroir of our site.</description>
