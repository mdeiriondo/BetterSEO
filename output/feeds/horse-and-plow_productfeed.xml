        <title>2018 Grenache Napa Valley</title>
        <description>This Grenache comes from the historic Block House Vineyard in Yountville. Brimming with juicy, red fruit and spice, its silky texture drinks beautifully on its own and pairs with a wide range of foods. The grapes were picked by hand, destemmed without crushing, and cold soaked for 7 days. We fermented each lot in small open-top tanks, performed manual punch downs, and aged in French oak barrels. This wine is not fined or filtered.&quot;A potpourri of dried flowers, red cherries, raspberries and cinnamon lights up the aroma of this full-bodied but lithe wine before fresh blackberries and more raspberries fill out the palate. With lively acidity and moderate tannins, the wine will be easy to pair with cheeses, meats and pastas. Organically grown. 94 Points, Editors' Choice.&quot; &amp;ndash; Wine Enthusiast</description>

        <description>This tiny lot of Gew&amp;uuml;rztraminer comes from the Larson Vineyard in the cool climate of Carneros in Sonoma County.

        <title>2023 Rosé Mendocino County</title>
        <description>Our signature dry ros&amp;eacute; was made from old-vine Carignane grown in Mendocino County and sourced from some of the oldest organic vineyards in California. Grapes are hand-harvested early in the season, when the sugar and acidity are ideal for crisp rosé. The clusters are crushed, then briefly soak on the skins for a gentle extraction of color and flavor before pressing. The juice is cold settled and fermented in neutral French oak barrels, resulting in a perfect balance of bright fruit, weight, and texture.
This vibrant, delicious ros&amp;eacute; has notes of tangerine, raspberry, wet stone, salinity and a slightly spicy, herbal finish. Its crisp acidity and low alcohol pair well with a wide range of foods, and it makes for a perfect sipping wine as well.

        <title>2023 Sauvignon Blanc Sonoma County</title>
        <description>Coming from the Cassata Vineyard, located in the rolling hills of Sonoma Valley and well suited for growing expressive Sauvignon Blanc. Its warm days, cool nights, hillside aspect, and biodynamic farming practices produce grapes full of flavor and balance. After hand-harvesting, the clusters are gently crushed then pressed. The crushing breaks the skins to allow for more spice and depth of flavor in the wine. The juice is briefly cold settled then transferred into neutral French oak barrels to ferment and age for 6 months sur lie. This lees contact in barrel adds richness to balance the bright fruit and acidity, resulting in a complex Sauvignon Blanc with depth and character.
Light bodied, elegant and crisp, this refreshing Sauvignon Blanc displays notes of lychee, white flowers, papaya, and a hint of lime zest. 250 cases made.</description>

        <title>Art Reception With Gage Opdenbrouw</title>
        <description>We are very excited to showcase new artwork from local artist Gage Opdenbrouw, and we invite you to join us for a reception at the tasting room on Friday, July 12th from 5-7pm, as we celebrate &quot;Mirror in the Garden,&quot; a stunning new solo exhibition of recent paintings.
&amp;ldquo;The Mirror in the Garden spans this last year and a half, exploring what happens inside and outside the garden and the reflective nature of self. At home, when there is very little light, and also, the reflections of ourselves in the dark, as we move between grief and attempts to see the world as is.
Sonoma County landscapes play a big role, but perhaps not the precious pastoral that we often think of in pleinair paintings. These are moody seasides, dark turns in the estuary, burned out buildings, the collapsed. Landscape and flowers as figure, and figures who understand not only impermanence but eco-collapse. At times, the paintings weep. I think that the place the show will most resonate with folks is that it is deeply familiar, and done so without over explanation. Gage detests the obvious. His skill is in capturing gestures within the shadow world.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Kelly Gray</description>

        <title>Farmhouse Cider</title>
        <description>One of our classic blends, Farmhouse is a rustic style of cider featuring a blend of apples that changes slightly from year to year, but that always has Gravenstein at its core (pardon the pun). In addition to Gravenstein, the blend of all Sebastopol-grown apples often includes Arkansas Black, Winesap, Newtown Pippin, and Jonathan. Each variety is fermented separately in small lots in a combination of neutral French oak and stainless steel until dry. Light to medium bodied with an appealing funky/earthy quality, green and yellow apple notes, crisp acidity and a lingering minerality.</description>

        <title>Live Music Sunday With Mike Hellman &amp; Full Band</title>
        <description>NOTE: Our live music events are 21 and over.
Join us on Sunday, September 8th from 2-4 pm when Mike Hellman, backed by a full band, performs at Horse &amp; Plow for the first time! Mike Hellman is a country and americana troubadour with a bent for the unconventional. Slinging songs with substance, conviction and grit, he&amp;rsquo;s on a mission to tell his truth and he insists on being heard. While firmly rooted in the rich country and blues traditions of his home state of Texas, he refuses to pander to clich&amp;eacute; and his sound is anything but predictable. His lively performances swing from ballad to barn burner to outright rock &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; roll, and his rich baritone conjures earnestness and humor while dealing head-on with all aspects of the human condition (and with a not-so-subtle nod to the underdog). An &amp;ldquo;outlaw&amp;rdquo; for outlaws, Mike's music transcends the often narrow boundaries set by the mainstream country music establishment. 
The seating is general admission and tickets are limited, so make sure to purchase your tickets soon and arrive early to grab your seat! $10 per person.
