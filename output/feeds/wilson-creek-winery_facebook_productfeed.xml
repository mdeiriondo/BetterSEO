REVIEWS: Employee favorite pick: &quot;The Meritage is a perfect balance of fruit, spice, and tannins. It is made predominately with Cab Franc grapes which adds a nice earthy characteristic to this wine. I wouldn't pair this with any food because it stands so strongly by itself. I would, however, recommend drinking this wine between dinner and dessert!&quot;</description>

DESCRIPTION: GSM is an abbreviation of Grenache, Syrah, Mourv&amp;egrave;dre and synonymous with the classic &quot;Southern Rhone Blend&quot;.

REVIEWS: Wine Server Herber's Favorite Pick: &quot;GSM got its name by being a blend of our Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvedr&amp;eacute; grapes. This is one of my favorites because it starts off low fruit forward but finishes off nice and dry. I would pair this with a tri-tip because the smokiness of the meat would complement this light bodied red.&quot;</description>

REVIEWS: Our wine server Adrienne&amp;rsquo;s favorite wine -  &quot;Ecclesia is Greek for social gathering.

 WINEMAKER - Kestutis VizgirdaKestutis &quot;Gus&quot; Vizgirda believes the secret to good winemaking begins in the vineyard. That's why throughout the growing season you will find him touring the rows of varietals and envisioning the kinds of wines he will produce from the harvest.  For over two decades, Vizgirda has worked at many local wineries, working with some of the Valley's best winemakers to refine his craft. Today, he has developed his own unique approach to making wine and has won gold medals for several of his varietals.In addition to serving as Wilson Creek's Winemaker, Vizgirda teaches wine classes at Mt. San Jacinto College and San Diego State University Extended Studies campus. He is also a judge at several local and international wine competitions.Kristina Filippi A lifelong resident of Southern California, Kristina Filippi grew up in the cradle of California&amp;rsquo;s winegrowing origins, the Cucamonga Valley. While attending college Kristina was hired to work in the winery tasting room at Joseph Filippi Winery in Rancho Cucamonga while she simultaneously attended Cal Poly Pomona and received a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Behavioral Science. It was during this time that she discovered her passion for wine and food pairing as well as the winemaking process. She soon enrolled in and graduated from the Le Cordon Bleu Culinary Arts program and went on to work at The Mission Inn Restaurant and Duane&amp;rsquo;s Prime Steaks and Seafood at the Historic Mission Inn in downtown Riverside.While following her culinary aspirations, Kristina continued to work part time at the winery, and began to help with harvest cellar tasks whenever she could.  In 2008, she was invited by the Filippi family to learn the winemaking process from the ground up and she jumped at the opportunity to turn her passion for wine into a career. She trained with enologist Tish Cooper and was advised by consultants Dr. Fred S. Nury, Emeritus Professor of Enology and Food Science at Cal State University Fresno, as well as retired winemaker and vintner Rene Biane. In the 10 years that she served as winemaker for Joseph Filippi Winery, she enjoyed working with grapes from vines that were over 100 years old, including Alicante Bouschet, Mission, Palomino, Pedro Ximenez, and Zinfandel varieties, as well as various varietals from younger vineyards, including Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Petite Sirah. Old-world winemaking traditions have greatly influenced her style, focusing on the idea of &amp;ldquo;less is more&amp;rdquo; while taking care to preserve the true character and expression of each varietal and its terroir. Kristina&amp;rsquo;s wines have earned gold medals and 90+ ratings, a couple of which include Double Gold and Best in Class for her Petite Sirah, and her Super Tuscan style red blend, Velluto which earned 91 pts from Wine Enthusiast.Kristina&amp;rsquo;s own family has viticultural roots in Southern California related to the San Gabriel Valley that reach back to 1784, and she moved here to Temecula in 2019 with hopes of getting in touch with those roots by learning more about the viticultural side of winemaking.  Prior to joining us here at Wilson Creek, she spent the last two years working in and managing vineyards in Temecula. We are extremely excited to have her as a part of our team and we know she will create some amazing wines for our winery.REVIEWS: Employee favorite pick: &quot;The Meritage is a perfect balance of fruit, spice, and tannins. It is made predominately with Cab Franc grapes which adds a nice earthy characteristic to this wine. I wouldn't pair this with any food because it stands so strongly by itself. I would, however, recommend drinking this wine between dinner and dessert!&quot;</description>

        <title>2021 Mourvedre</title>
        <description>DESCRIPTION: Our 2021 Mourv&amp;egrave;dre is a sensory journey, revealing the true character of this Mediterranean varietal. With every sip, you'll encounter a bouquet of sun-ripened red fruits, floral notes, and a hint of spice, all harmoniously intertwined. This wine's graceful structure and silky texture make it a perfect companion for an array of culinary delights or a standout selection for any special occasion.
WINE MAKING NOTES: 82% Mourvedre, 18% Zinfandel | Fermentation: | Oak: American and French Oak | Oak age:21 months|  Harvest Brix: 24.1 (average)  |  Bottle Date: May 3, 2023  |  Cases Produced: 368  |  Maturity: now until 2026FLAVOR AND AROMA NOTES: The aromas are subtle caramel oak, richly layered with raspberry, currents and finishing with tart cherries. In its core, you may find plum flavors. This wine is complex, acid driven and with soft tannins.
PAIRING SUGGESTIONS: This wine pairs well with sheep's milk cheese, grilled portabello mushrooms, marinated olives, chili glazed meatballs or Creekside Grille's own rabit Bolognese!
VINEYARD NOTES: Our Mourvedre is grown near Merlot Mesa in the back of our vineyard. This Mourvedre was barrel selected and aged primarily in French Oak. This varietal can be difficult to grow, preferring &quot;It's face in the sun and feet in the water&quot;, meaning it needs warm weather, low leaf-to-fruit ratio and adequate water to produce the desired characteristics of Mourvedre. At about 1.5 acres Mourv&amp;egrave;dre is one of our smallest blocks in the vineyard. This grape is used to make small amounts of Mourv&amp;egrave;dre wine and is the &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; in our GSM red wine blend. Block 14- Planted in 2002 just above the Merlot, about half of this block was later grafted to Malbec. Mourv&amp;egrave;dre is one of the last grapes to bud and is also one of the last grapes to be harvested each year.Mourv&amp;egrave;dre Block 14 planted 2022, FPS clone 03 on 1103P rootstock, 1.6 Acres, average yield 3.2 tons per acre drip irrigated, Arlington Sandy Loam soils, 447 meters ( 1467 ft), excellent draining, farmed regeneratively. A heat loving grape well known for its production in the southern Rhone and Provence with a similar Mediterranean climate as Temecula. Also grown in warm regions of  Span where it is known as  Monastrell.We affectionately call Mourv&amp;egrave;dre our problem child as it produces large clusters that need adequate sun good ventilation and absolutely under no circumstances can they touch each other, like siblings in the back seat of a car. We chose a vineyard with a slight north facing declination to extend the ripening. of this already late ripening varietal. This allows us to retain natural acids while the fruit comes to full physiological maturity and brings out all the expressive balance between complex ripe fruit and natural skin and seed tannins. The shoot spacing for Mourv&amp;egrave;dre is considerably further apart than most other varietals to give room for exceptionally large clusters to fully develop and have adequate sun and air for proper development. Mourv&amp;egrave;dre naturally tends to over produce, so this conservative pruning technique allows us to keep the yield to a moderate level and the quality extremely high. Like many problem children, if you understand their idiosyncrasies and do your best to cultivate their potential, you'll be richly rewarded with wine that gets an advanced degree and complexity and terroir.MEET OUR WINEMAKERS - Kestutis Vizgirda &quot;Gus&quot;  believes the secret to good winemaking begins in the vineyard. That's why throughout the growing season you will find him touring the rows of varietals and envisioning the kinds of wines he will produce from the harvest.  For over two decades, Vizgirda has worked at several local wineries, working with some of the Valley's best winemakers to refine his craft. Today, he has developed his own unique approach to making wine and has won gold medals for several of his varietals.In addition to serving as Wilson Creek's Winemaker, Vizgirda teaches wine classes at Mt. San Jacinto College and San Diego State University Extended Studies campus. He is also a judge at several local and international wine competitions.Kristina Filippi - Born and raised in Southern California's Cucamonga Valley, Kristina Filippi's wine journey began while attending college.

Kristina Filippi A lifelong resident of Southern California, Kristina Filippi grew up in the cradle of California&amp;rsquo;s winegrowing origins, the Cucamonga Valley. While attending college Kristina was hired to work in the winery tasting room at Joseph Filippi Winery in Rancho Cucamonga while she simultaneously attended Cal Poly Pomona and received a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Behavioral Science. It was during this time that she discovered her passion for wine and food pairing as well as the winemaking process. She soon enrolled in and graduated from the Le Cordon Bleu Culinary Arts program and went on to work at The Mission Inn Restaurant and Duane&amp;rsquo;s Prime Steaks and Seafood at the Historic Mission Inn in downtown Riverside.While following her culinary aspirations, Kristina continued to work part time at the winery, and began to help with harvest cellar tasks whenever she could.  In 2008, she was invited by the Filippi family to learn the winemaking process from the ground up and she jumped at the opportunity to turn her passion for wine into a career. She trained with enologist Tish Cooper and was advised by consultants Dr. Fred S. Nury, Emeritus Professor of Enology and Food Science at Cal State University Fresno, as well as retired winemaker and vintner Rene Biane. In the 10 years that she served as winemaker for Joseph Filippi Winery, she enjoyed working with grapes from vines that were over 100 years old, including Alicante Bouschet, Mission, Palomino, Pedro Ximenez, and Zinfandel varieties, as well as various varietals from younger vineyards, including Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Petite Sirah. Old-world winemaking traditions have greatly influenced her style, focusing on the idea of &amp;ldquo;less is more&amp;rdquo; while taking care to preserve the true character and expression of each varietal and its terroir. Kristina&amp;rsquo;s wines have earned gold medals and 90+ ratings, a couple of which include Double Gold and Best in Class for her Petite Sirah, and her Super Tuscan style red blend, Velluto which earned 91 pts from Wine Enthusiast.Kristina&amp;rsquo;s own family has viticultural roots in Southern California related to the San Gabriel Valley that reach back to 1784, and she moved here to Temecula in 2019 with hopes of getting in touch with those roots by learning more about the viticultural side of winemaking.  Prior to joining us here at Wilson Creek, she spent the last two years working in and managing vineyards in Temecula. We are extremely excited to have her as a part of our team and we know she will create some amazing wines for our winery.
REVIEWS: Wine Club Member: Randy Molde Whether nibbling on citrus or chewing on cheese, swirling the Moscato brings sunrise to the taste buds. This wine will have you anticipating each and every sip.

        <title>2022 Yes Dear Chardonnay</title>
        <description>DESCRIPTION: Golden warmth emanates from this wine, accompanied by the inviting fragrance of green apple and sweet French oak. Baked apple intertwined with subtle notes of warm vanilla and spice, for a velvety, buttery finish. 
WINE MAKING NOTES:  Our winemaker was tasked by the Wilson Family wives to produce a silky buttery Chardonnay. Grape Blend: 95% Chardonnay, 5% ViognierTA: 5.6 gm/L | PH: 3.34 | RS: 0.92 | Alcohol: 13.0% Fermentation: Oak &amp; Stainless Tank | Oak: French | Oak age:7 months | Harvest Brix: 24 (average)  |  Bottle Date: July 14, 2023  |  Cases Produced: 1437  |  Maturity: now until 2025
FLAVOR AND AROMA NOTES: Baked apple, hints of warm vanilla, spice with a buttery soft finish. 
PAIRING SUGGESTIONS: A fantastic cocktail wine. Try with a wide variety of soft cheeses, toasted nuts, lobster or bacon wrapped scallops.
VINEYARD NOTES: One half of this &quot;Yes Dear&quot; Chardonnay was fermented in French Oak barrels and the other half in stainless tank. The combination of the fruitiness of the stainless and the oak depth and softness of the oak are evident in the aroma and flavors of the wine.Check out our blog post on why Temecula Valley is a great place to grow chardonnay grapes for more information.Wilson Creek has two blocks of Chardonnay, one of the main grape varieties grown on property. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly used in making &amp;ldquo;Yes Dear&amp;rdquo; Chardonnay. This is one of the first grape varieties to &amp;ldquo;Bud-out&amp;rdquo; after the winter dormancy and one of the first grapes to be harvested.
Block 2- Little more than 4 acres was planted in 1970. This Block is located behind Rosie&amp;rsquo;s house behind the gradual rise north of the courtyard. The southern edge is somewhat flat but sloping downward on its northern edge. Due to its age, this block produces deep rich flavorful grapes.Block 6- Planted in 2006 in a 2.5-acre block, this Chardonnay is located just above our Roussanne and below a block of Petite Sirah. Since wine grapes are self-pollinating there is no need for insect pollinators like bees. As a result, there is no concern regarding crosspollination with the surrounding grape varieties. The Chardonnay from this block display a vibrant acidity and fruitiness perfect for out &amp;ldquo;Yes Dear&amp;rdquo;.

The Route 91 Anniversary Wine is a symbol of healing, remembrance, and the power of unity in the face of adversity. Each year, the group that attended the festival gets together for a time of healing and hand labels each bottle.

REVIEWS: Wine server Karli's favorite &quot;My favorite is our Brut Sparkling. I think this wine pairs well with a charcuterie board. Specifically, a brie cheese with some fig jam! If you are looking for something crisp and refreshing on a warm day, this is the wine for you. This wine is also special because our winery dog, Brut is named after it!&quot;</description>

        <title>Friday Night Late Nights With Brandon Wildish Music  | Aug 2nd</title>
        <description>Have a night out with friends in Wine Country! Enjoy wine, delicious food, and live music. No reservations needed - just come on in from 5pm - 8:30pm.
About Brandon Wildish Music:
Based out of Orange County California, Brandon Wildish first picked up the guitar a little over 20 years ago and has been a gigging musician for 15 of those years. Early in his career he played intimate settings such as small venues and coffee shops. Years later he helped create the alternative rock group called Hope Departed. Brandon was in this group for several years and had an opportunity to play with other great bands like Bad Religion, Cotton Mouth Kings, Pepper, A Static Lullaby, Over It, and more.   ​Brandon released his debut solo album (Simplicities) in November 2013. In late 2016, Brandon released his second album (Other Side), which received great reviews and press that has reached as far as London. Blending the sounds of both acoustic folk and alternative rock, Brandon has been described as having a  relaxed west coast vibe, similar to Jason Mraz, with classic rock roots grounded in the stylings of Pink Floyd.  </description>

        <description>This Easter Sunday, enjoy wine, delicious food, and live music! Just come on in from 12pm-4pm. No reservations needed!
Michael Battista&amp;rsquo;s talent with a variety of musical instruments and genres, combined with his strong vocals and unique style has found an appreciative audience with adoring fans.  Although the Spanish guitar had been the foundation of his music, his vast influences have afforded him the ability not to restrict himself to any one particular genre.  For his newest productions, Battista has gone back to his electric guitar roots and incorporated it back into his music.  As well, Battista has fallen in love with the sound of an Orchestra, so he now loves to compose all of the orchestration that accompanies his new music.</description>

        <title>Live Music With Michael Leclerc | May 27th</title>
        <description>This Memorial Day, enjoy wine, delicious food, and live music! Just come on in from 12pm-4pm. No reservations needed!
Michael LeClerc is a Canadian singer/songwriter with a style reminiscent of Van Morrison, Dave Matthews or Jack Johnson. His sweet and soulful voice penetrates deeply, with a dream-like quality against an acoustic guitar that drifts between deftly executed finger-style to jangly strumming, and segues easily from love ballad to upbeat rocker. Currently located in Southern California, he is carving a niche for himself up and down the west coast, playing wineries, clubs and songwriter showcases from San Diego to Vancouver, Canada. </description>

MEET OUR WINEMAKERS - Kestutis Vizgirda &amp;ldquo;Gus&amp;rdquo; Vizgirda, the former winemaker at Wilson Creek Winery, believed that the essence of fine winemaking begins in the vineyard. Throughout the growing season, he could be found strolling the rows of grapevines, imagining the wines he would craft from the harvest. A first-generation American whose parents immigrated from Lithuania in 1949, Gus grew up in a small farming community along the Fox River in Illinois. &amp;ldquo;I was raised in a farming culture where growing crops and producing food was simply a way of life. My interest in wines and winemaking blossomed during my time in the Air Force, stationed in Germany. I spent my leave days touring wineries along the Rhine River, and that&amp;rsquo;s when I knew I wanted to become a winemaker.&amp;rdquo; After his Air Force service, Gus settled in California, eventually finding his way to Temecula, where the nascent wine culture was shaping what would become Southern California Wine Country. He landed a position at what was then The Culbertson Winery and began an apprenticeship under the tutelage of the legendary local winemaker Jon McPhearson. &amp;ldquo;I was captivated by the winemaking process from the outset, and I was determined to master the craft from the ground up.&amp;rdquo;Over the next two decades, Gus honed his skills at several local wineries, collaborating with some of the Valley&amp;rsquo;s most esteemed winemakers, including Phil Baily, Mike Tingley, Jon McPherson, Steve Hagata, and Joe Cherpin. His dedication paid off with numerous gold medals for his varietals, including accolades such as &amp;ldquo;Best Viognier in the State&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Best Sauvignon in the State&amp;rdquo; at the California State Competition.Gus joined Wilson Creek as Winemaker in 2014 and left an enduring legacy with his exceptional vintage wines. He became renowned for his &amp;ldquo;White Cabernet Sauvignon,&amp;rdquo; which remains one of Wilson Creek&amp;rsquo;s most beloved wines. In addition to his role as Wilson Creek Winemaker, Gus taught wine classes at Mt. San Jacinto College and San Diego State University Extended Studies campus, and served as a judge at various local and international wine competitions.

REVIEWS:  Server- Torrance's Favorite:&quot;I chose the Plethora because I find it fascinating that a wine that is a blend of nine different grape varieties can be this enjoyable. I would say this wine is a perfect medium bodied red. I think that the combination of the different grape varieties, pulls this wine together to be the red wine that anyone could enjoy. When I drink this wine at home, I like to pair it with a nice chicken breast with potatoes and asparagus.&quot;</description>

        <title>Perfect Wine &amp; Cheese Pairing</title>
        <description>Create a delightful culinary experience with this 3-pk of wine to include our 2022 Viognier, Sparkling Almond wine and 2020 Bourbon Barrel Zinfandel. These wines are a delightful companion for a variety of cheeses.
ALMOND SPARKING: This white sparkling wine ( formerly known as Almond Champagne) is naturally fermented, with just an essence of natural almond added so it's guaranteed to dazzle your guests. A must have sparkling wine to make any occasion extra special. WINE MAKING NOTES: Grape Blend: French Columbard and California Chardonnay | TA: 6.2 gm/L  |  PH: 3.13  |  RS: 5.8  |  Alcohol: 11% | Fermentation: Tank  |  Harvest Brix: 24.5(average)FLAVOR AND AROMA NOTES: Persistent small bubbles form a light mousse on top of the wine in the glass. This sparkling is naturally fermented with pure almond flavor added. The almond is very clean and aromatic with sweet almond marzipan dominating the bouquet and lingering in the finish along with a hint of caramelized sugar. Crisp refreshing finish. PAIRING SUGGESTIONS: Pairs well with mild cheeses such as Brie and Apricot Stilton cheese. Great with desserts, cuddling, hot tubs, picnics, firplaces, brunch and weddings.
2022 Viognier: The delicate peachy color of this wine is an apt prelude to the inviting aroma of honeysuckle,ripe apricot and fragrant guava on the nose, transforming into flavors of juicy peach, jasmine and citrus rind on the palate. WINE MAKING NOTES: Grape Blend: 100% Viognier  | TA: 5.9 gm/L  |  PH: 3.55 |  RS: 0.39 |  Alcohol: 12.3%  | Fermentation: Stainless Tank |  Oak:N/A | Oak age:N/A |  Harvest Brix: 23.4 (average)  |  Bottle Date: March 30 ,2023   |  Cases Produced: 757  |  Maturity: now until 2025FLAVOR AND AROMA NOTES: This wine has fresh fruit aromas of honeysuckle, ripe apricot and fragrant guava with a hint of citrus rind in the finish. PAIRING SUGGESTIONS: This Viognier's aromatic and fruit forward nature makes this wine pair well with grilled salmon, shellfish or spicy Indian food. Try triple cream brie, gorgonzola with honey. VINEYARD NOTES: Our Viognier was planted in 2002 and located on the northwestern side of the vineyard and just below the Muscat block. An additional acre was added in 2012 by grafting Viognier to Cabernet increasing the Viognier acreage to just under 4 acres. Block 11- This block is on higher ground then its Muscat neighbor and usually is unaffected by last season frost. This section is on the other side of the vineyard access road from MERLOT MESA. Block 12- This is the one acre grafted section of Viognier below block 11.
2020 Bourbon Barrel Zinfandel: Deep ruby in color with smooth, medium bodied wine with great acidity. Multi-layered wine with flavors of blackberry and ripe cherry and smokiness on the nose from the bourbon barrel char. WINE MAKING NOTES: Grape Blend: 100% Zinfandel | TA: 6.4 gm/L  |  PH: 3.72  |  RS: .57  |  Alcohol: 14.3% | Fermentation: open ferment  |  Oak: Bourbon Barrel | Oak age: 8 months  |  Harvest Brix: 24.5 (average)  |  Bottle Date: May 2, 2022 |  Cases Produced: 2076  |  Maturity: now until 2025FLAVOR AND AROMA NOTES: Youthful Zinfandel aged on Bourbon barrels to create layers of flavorful dark plum, ripe cherry and light charred oak.  PAIRING SUGGESTIONS: This wine pairs well with gouda cheeses grilled peppers and roasted eggplant. Perfect for a roasted Thanksgiving turkey. VINEYARD NOTES: We started with a robust, fruit forward old vine Zinfandel. We then aged this wine in Bourbon Whiskey oak barrels. The result? A Zinfandel with something extra with very distinct American Oak and light Bourbon char aromas. </description>

        <title>Red, Almond &amp; Blue</title>
        <description>A perfect 3pk of our most popular wines. Makes a great gift! VS series White Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet-Zinfandel &amp; Almond Sparkling.
DESCRIPTION: NV VS White Cabernet Sauvignon Strawberry, melon and peach are prominent with subtle floral back notes. This wine plays on your palate integrating well with its acidity and sweetness. 
WINE MAKING NOTES: Grape Blend: 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, TA: 6.4 gm/L  |  PH: 3.43 |  RS: 2.7 |  Alcohol: 11.2%, Fermentation: Stainless Tank | Oak: N/A | Oak age: N/A |  Harvest Brix: 21.3 (average)  |  Bottle Date: Nov 16, 2023  |  Cases Produced: 2000  |  Maturity: now until 2025
PAIRING SUGGESTIONS: Spicy Thai dishes, curry spiced dishes, fruit vinaigrette salads with goat cheese.
 VINEYARD NOTES: Most White Cabernets are darker in color due to a more vigorous pressing, A softer press keeps most of the color locked in the skin, the result is a softer more subtle wine. 
REVIEWS: Wine server, Scot's Favorite&quot;My favorite wine is the VS White Cabernet. I love the wine because it is fruity without being too sweet. At home, I like to pair this wine with honey glazed salmon. I think this win is special because it is made from our Cabernet grapes, but it is made from through our white wine process. This allows us to enjoy the flavors of our Cabernet grapes, which is fruity and has a strawberry/raspberry character, but in a white wine!&quot;
 DESCRIPTION: NV VS CABERNET ZINFANDEL: Our Variant Series is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. This very popular blend integrates the concentrated jammy aromas and flavors of a Zinfandel, to the well structed frame work of a Cabernet Sauvignon.
WINE MAKING NOTES: Grape Blend: 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 50% Zinfandel TA: 6.9 gm/L  |  PH: 3.66  |  RS: 1.7  |  Alcohol: 14.3%, Fermentation: Stainless |  Oak: American  | Oak age: 15 months   Harvest Brix: 23.2 (average)  |  Bottle Date: DEC 6, 2023 |  Cases Produced: 1082  |  Maturity: now until 2024
FLAVOR AND AROMA NOTES: Full body wine and lots of fruit. Jammy but holds structure of a Cabernet Sauvignon.
PAIRING SUGGESTIONS: Our Variant Cabernet Zinfandel blended wine makes for a great outdoor barbecue red wine. Serve it slightly chilled with a Texas style barbecue brisket.
DESCRIPTION: Sparkling Almond Wine This white sparkling wine (formerly known as Almond Champagne) is naturally fermented, with just an essence of natural almond added so it's guaranteed to dazzle your guests. WINE MAKING NOTES: Grape Blend: French Columbard and Chardonnay, TA: 6.2 gm/L  |  PH: 3.13  |  RS: 5.8  |  Alcohol: 11%, Fermentation: Tank |  Oak: None  | Oak age: N/A  |  Harvest Brix: 24.5(average)  |  Bottle Date: April, November |  Cases Produced: 30,000 |  Maturity: Enjoy within 15 months of purchase

REVIEWS: Wedding and Events Team, Yvette's Favorite&quot;I love this Almond Sparkling because it is crisp and refreshing. With the weather heating up, this is my favorite summer drink. It is a very versatile wine that compliments breakfast food, dessert, and everything in between! My favorite way to enjoy the Almond Sparkling is in a mimosa. You can make it with orange juice, or you're feeling adventurous pomegranate juice!&quot;</description>

REVIEW: Wine server Stephanie's favorite wine: Sparkling Sangria&quot;Our Sparkling Sangria was the first wine I fell in love with here at Wilson! I love that it is fruity without being overly sweet. When I enjoy this wine at home, I like to add my own fresh berries to it and sip it out by the pool. I would pair this wine with our Vineyard Salad at the Creekside Grille! I think the strawberries and blue cheese would truly compliment the wine.&quot; Enjoy regular shipments of our Sangria Sparkling wine throughout the year, plus receive special member-only perks and discounts by joining a Wilson Creek Wine Club.

WINEMAKER-Kestutis &amp;ldquo;Gus&amp;rdquo; Vizgirda, the former winemaker at Wilson Creek Winery, believed that the essence of fine winemaking begins in the vineyard. Throughout the growing season, he could be found strolling the rows of grapevines, imagining the wines he would craft from the harvest. A first-generation American whose parents immigrated from Lithuania in 1949, Gus grew up in a small farming community along the Fox River in Illinois.&amp;ldquo;I was raised in a farming culture where growing crops and producing food was simply a way of life. My interest in wines and winemaking blossomed during my time in the Air Force, stationed in Germany. I spent my leave days touring wineries along the Rhine River, and that&amp;rsquo;s when I knew I wanted to become a winemaker.&amp;rdquo; After his Air Force service, Gus settled in California, eventually finding his way to Temecula, where the nascent wine culture was shaping what would become Southern California Wine Country. He landed a position at what was then The Culbertson Winery and began an apprenticeship under the tutelage of the legendary local winemaker Jon McPhearson.&amp;ldquo;I was captivated by the winemaking process from the outset, and I was determined to master the craft from the ground up.&amp;rdquo;Over the next two decades, Gus honed his skills at several local wineries, collaborating with some of the Valley&amp;rsquo;s most esteemed winemakers, including Phil Baily, Mike Tingley, Jon McPherson, Steve Hagata, and Joe Cherpin. His dedication paid off with numerous gold medals for his varietals, including accolades such as &amp;ldquo;Best Viognier in the State&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Best Sauvignon in the State&amp;rdquo; at the California State Competition.Gus joined Wilson Creek as Winemaker in 2014 and left an enduring legacy with his exceptional vintage wines. He became renowned for his &amp;ldquo;White Cabernet Sauvignon,&amp;rdquo; which remains one of Wilson Creek&amp;rsquo;s most beloved wines. In addition to his role as Wilson Creek Winemaker, Gus taught wine classes at Mt. San Jacinto College and San Diego State University Extended Studies campus, and served as a judge at various local and international wine competitions.Though Gus has retired from Wilson Creek, his influence and the wines he crafted continue to delight wine enthusiasts, ensuring that his passion for winemaking lives on in every bottle bearing his mark.
MEET OUR WINEMAKER- Kristina Filippi - Born and raised in Southern California's Cucamonga Valley, Kristina Filippi's wine journey began while attending college. Her passion for wine and food pairing led her to Le Cordon Bleu Culinary Arts program. She worked at renowned restaurants while helping with winemaking at Joseph Filippi Winery. In 2008, Kristina embraced winemaking as a career, training with experts and becoming the winemaker at Joseph Filippi Winery for over a decade. She developed an old-world winemaking style, creating award-winning wines. Kristina's family has deep viticultural roots, dating back to 1784 in the San Gabriel Valley. In 2019, she moved to Temecula to explore her viticultural heritage. After managing vineyards in Temecula, she now joins Wilson Creek, bringing her expertise to our team. We're excited about the exceptional wines she'll craft.</description>

WINEMAKER - Kestutis &amp;ldquo;Gus&amp;rdquo; Vizgirda, the former winemaker at Wilson Creek Winery, believed that the essence of fine winemaking begins in the vineyard. Throughout the growing season, he could be found strolling the rows of grapevines, imagining the wines he would craft from the harvest. A first-generation American whose parents immigrated from Lithuania in 1949, Gus grew up in a small farming community along the Fox River in Illinois. &amp;ldquo;I was raised in a farming culture where growing crops and producing food was simply a way of life. My interest in wines and winemaking blossomed during my time in the Air Force, stationed in Germany. I spent my leave days touring wineries along the Rhine River, and that&amp;rsquo;s when I knew I wanted to become a winemaker.&amp;rdquo; After his Air Force service, Gus settled in California, eventually finding his way to Temecula, where the nascent wine culture was shaping what would become Southern California Wine Country. He landed a position at what was then The Culbertson Winery and began an apprenticeship under the tutelage of the legendary local winemaker Jon McPhearson.&amp;ldquo;I was captivated by the winemaking process from the outset, and I was determined to master the craft from the ground up.&amp;rdquo;Over the next two decades, Gus honed his skills at several local wineries, collaborating with some of the Valley&amp;rsquo;s most esteemed winemakers, including Phil Baily, Mike Tingley, Jon McPherson, Steve Hagata, and Joe Cherpin. His dedication paid off with numerous gold medals for his varietals, including accolades such as &amp;ldquo;Best Viognier in the State&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Best Sauvignon in the State&amp;rdquo; at the California State Competition.Gus joined Wilson Creek as Winemaker in 2014 and left an enduring legacy with his exceptional vintage wines. He became renowned for his &amp;ldquo;White Cabernet Sauvignon,&amp;rdquo; which remains one of Wilson Creek&amp;rsquo;s most beloved wines. In addition to his role as Wilson Creek Winemaker, Gus taught wine classes at Mt. San Jacinto College and San Diego State University Extended Studies campus, and served as a judge at various local and international wine competitions.Though Gus has retired from Wilson Creek, his influence and the wines he crafted continue to delight wine enthusiasts, ensuring that his passion for winemaking lives on in every bottle bearing his mark.
