        <title>2019 Double L Pinot Noir 1.5l</title>
        <description>Conscientiously farmed since the original plantings in 1997, today Morgan's Double L Estate Vineyard is the only certified organic vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands. Located at the northern end of the AVA, the vineyard's north-south row orientation provides optimal wind and sun exposure.
The grapes were hand-picked and sorted in the vineyard, then sorted again at the winery. Native yeasts began the seven percent whole cluster fermentation in open-top tanks. After fermentation, the wine was transferred into 36% new French oak for ten months of aging.
The 2019 Double L Pinot Noir is rich yet energetic. Aromas of black cherry, pine forest, and rose petals are supported on the palate by flavors of red and black fruits, with a hint of cinnamon. This wine features a medium body, crisp acidity, and elegant tannins; an exquisite match for duck confit, lamb shank, or prime rib.

        <title>2020 Cotes Du Crow's</title>
        <description>&quot;One of those wines that you smell, and it just brings a smile to your face.&quot;
Cotes du Crow&amp;rsquo;s is a unique blend of the two noble, predominant red varietals of France&amp;rsquo;s southern Rh&amp;ocirc;ne Valley: grenache and syrah. Small amounts of  mourv&amp;egrave;dre and tempranillo are included, whose earthy, meaty spice and dark fruit are beautiful complements to the grenache and syrah.Fermented in open top tanks with manual punch-downs, enabling good extraction and structure development with pleasant tannins. After fermentation, the wine was transferred to French oak barrels, giving subtle spice and vanilla characters without overpowering the elegant fruit profile.This Rh&amp;ocirc;ne-style blend has a rich ruby color, highlighted by purple edges.Notes of boysenberry, bramble, and tobacco jump out of the glass. The wine is full bodied with rich tannins, offering flavors of black fruits, damp earth, and chocolate covered cherry. Its weight and balance make it a perfect pairing for anything off the grill.Download tech sheet.</description>

        <title>2021 Double L Chardonnay</title>
        <description>&quot;Drips with quality and deliciousness...&quot; 
Conscientiously farmed since the original plantings in 1997, today Morgan&amp;rsquo;s Double L Estate Vineyard is the only certified organic vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands. Located at the northern end of the AVA, the vineyard&amp;rsquo;s north-south row orientation provides optimal wind and sun exposure.  
The grapes were picked when the flavor and acid balance was optimal, then hand-sorted and gently pressed to yield the highest quality juice. The juice was fermented in 35% new French oak. Full malolactic and lees stirring were conducted to obtain a medium plus body, balanced by fresh acidity.Notes of lemon blossom, caramel, and baking spices are echoed on the palate by lemon curd, salted toffee, and toasted coconut. One of the finest food wines, the Double L Chardonnay will pair wonderfully with seafood and poultry dishes, as well as a buttery steak.

        <title>2021 G17 Syrah</title>
        <description>&quot;It'll make a Syrah lover out if you!&quot;
The name &amp;ldquo;G17&amp;rdquo; refers to one of Monterey County's best known route, linking several of our grape growing appellations.
The wine was fermented in open top tanks and received daily punch-downs. This enabled optimal extraction and structure development, while maintaining elegant tannins. After fermentation, the wine was transferred to French oak barrels. The 20% new oak gives the wine subtle spice and vanilla characters, without overpowering the elegant fruit profile.
This Rhone-style blend has a garnet color highlighted with purple edges. Aromas of brambly black fruit, raspberry hard candy, and hints of savory spice jump out of the glass. The wine is medium-plus bodied with crisp acidity, offering flavors of purple fruits and smoked meat. Its weight and balance make it a perfect pairing with anything off the grill.

        <title>2021 Mcintyre Chardonnay</title>
        <description>&quot;Really classy stuff.&quot;
Originally planted in 1973, McIntyre Vineyard boasts some of the oldest vines in the Santa Lucia Highlands. Owner Steve McIntyre is one of the originators of the SIP (Sustainable in Practice) Certification Program, combining his conscientious farming techniques with the property&amp;rsquo;s coastal influence to grow grapes with complex terroir expression.Hand sorted grapes were whole cluster pressed, preserving fruit flavors and natural acidity. The juice was barrel fermented in 28% new French oak, followed by nine months of barrel aging.
In the glass, the McIntyre Vineyard Chardonnay displays a beautiful light straw hue. On the nose, aromas of quince are joined by Nilla Wafer and sea breeze. Those elements are echoed on the palate by green apple, crushed rock, and lemon curd. Malolactic fermentation adds a rounded mouthfeel to the wine&amp;rsquo;s fresh fruit and bright acidity.Download tech sheet.</description>

        <title>2021 Tempranillo</title>
        <description>&quot;An energetic and refreshing style rarely seen in California.&quot;
Located on the west side of the Salinas Valley, the Arroyo Seco appellation is uniquely characterized by an ancient riverbed (arroyo seco means &amp;lsquo;dry river&amp;rsquo;) surrounded by alluvial benchlands. Well-drained, stone-laden soil and cool coastal influence from nearby Monterey Bay yield grapes with concentrated flavor and balanced acidity.  
The grapes were hand sorted in the vineyard and again at the winery before being completely destemmed. Whole berries were fermented in small open-top tanks. Gentle punch-downs provided for optimum extraction, while maintaining an elegantly structured wine. The wine was aged for ten months in 20% new French oak.The 2021 Tempranillo has a beautiful garnet color with aromas of lingonberry, blackberry, pepper, and damp earth. On the palate it displays lingering flavors of red and black fruits, bay laurel, and bramble. This wine features a medium body, elegant chalky tannins, and medium acidity &amp;mdash; delicious by itself or paired with savory grilled meats and aged cheeses.Download tech sheet.</description>

        <title>2022 Double L Pinot Noir (clone 667)</title>
        <description>&quot;This beautiful representation of Santa Lucia Highlands just keeps giving!&quot;
Conscientiously farmed since the original plantings in 1997, today Morgan&amp;rsquo;s Double L Estate Vineyard is the only certified organic vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands. Located at the northern end of the AVA, the vineyard&amp;rsquo;s north-south row orientation provides optimal wind and sun exposure.The 2022 growing season commenced in early March, after a dry winter and freezing temperatures just before budbreak. Cool and windy weather throughout flowering, paired with drought conditions, led to reduced cluster counts across the region. Above average summer temperatures and decreased marine layer, along with a heatwave Labor Day Weekend, compelled an early, concentrated harvest that concluded by mid October. The vintage will be clean, fruit-driven, and fairly opulent &amp;ndash; wines that truly tell a story.The 2022 Double L Pinot Noir Clone 667 is lean and energetic. Aromas of wild cherry,  rose petal, and pine forest are supported on the palate by bright red fruits, with a hint of rose hips and savory herbs. This wine features a light body with lithe tannins &amp;mdash; an exquisite match for duck confit or grilled salmon.For tech sheet click here</description>

        <title>2022 Double L Pinot Noir (clone 828)</title>
        <description>&quot;Drew me in with its irresistible core of fruit flavors!&quot;
Conscientiously farmed since the original plantings in 1997, today Morgan&amp;rsquo;s Double L Estate Vineyard is the only certified organic vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands. Located at the northern end of the AVA, the vineyard&amp;rsquo;s north-south row orientation provides optimal wind and sun exposure.The background of Clone 828 is quite unclear- some say it originated from La T&amp;acirc;che in Burgundy, some say it&amp;rsquo;s a Dijon clone, and some say it&amp;rsquo;s neither. What&amp;rsquo;s certain about our 828 is that it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;pinot dro&amp;icirc;t&amp;rdquo; clone, meaning that its shoots stand upright, as opposed to falling over if not hedged and trellised like many other pinot clones. It puts out a consistently healthy crop, ripens late, retains acidity well, and produces a medium colored, elegant pinot noir.The 2022 Double L Pinot Noir Clone 828 is bright and energetic, with aromas of cherry cola, baking spices, and blackberry are supported on the palate by toasted vanilla and black fruits. This wine features a medium body with lithe tannins - an exquisite match for duck confit and grilled salmon.Download tech sheet.</description>

        <title>2022 Double L Pinot Noir (clone Lt)</title>
        <description>Located in the well-drained foothills above the Salinas Valley, the Santa Lucia Highlands Appellation is California&amp;rsquo;s most distinctive region for growing terroir-driven wines. Strong afternoon winds and coastal fog originating from nearby Monterey Bay flow through the AVA, resulting in one of the longest growing seasons in North America.Clone LT refers to one of the most celebrated Pinot Noir vineyards in Burgundy. We grafted a small block of this elegant suitcase clone at the top of Double L Vineyard. The 2022 Double L Pinot Noir Clone LT is seductive and energetic, with aromas of baking spices and blackberry, joined by anise. Rich and smooth on the palate, intense flavors of black cherries and fresh blueberries are complemented by clove. This wine features a light body with soft tannins &amp;mdash; an exquisite match for lamb, duck, and mushroom dishes.

        <title>2022 Tondré Chardonnay</title>
        <description> &quot;Steely minerality that many Chardonnay aficionados relish.&quot;
Tondr&amp;eacute; Alarid and son Joe Alarid, both steeped in California&amp;rsquo;s agricultural history, planted Tondr&amp;eacute; Grapefield in 1997. Exposed southeast facing slopes, strong marine influence, and well-draining glacial soils are the recipe for ultra-premium fruit. Tondr&amp;eacute; Grapefield is SIP Certified, underlining the Alarids&amp;rsquo; commitment to sustainable farming practices.Hand-sorted grapes were whole cluster pressed, preserving fruit flavors and natural acidity. Barrel fermentation in 32% new French oak began with native yeast. Fifty percent malo-lactic fermentation and lees stirring were conducted to obtain a medium body with balanced richness and acidity.In the glass, the wine displays a beautiful light golden hue. Perfumes of green apple, lemon, and coconut are supported by nilla wafer, meyer lemon, and a hint of vanilla bean on the palate. It should be served at cellar temperature and will go well with flavorful seafood and poultry dishes.

Tondr&amp;eacute; Alarid and son Joe Alarid, both steeped in California&amp;rsquo;s agricultural history, planted Tondr&amp;eacute; Grapefield in 1997. Exposed southeast facing slopes, strong marine influence, and well-draining glacial soils are the recipe for ultra-premium fruit. Tondr&amp;eacute; Grapefield is SIP Certified, underlining the Alarids&amp;rsquo; commitment to sustainable farming practices.The grapes were completely destemmed after hand sorting. Gentle punch downs produced a wine with supple texture and soft tannins. The wine was transferred to 40% new French oak barrels for malo-lactic fermentation and 11 months of aging.On the nose is blackberry, highlighted by smoked meats and sweet baking spices. Flavors of black fruit, toasted caramel, and espresso bean are framed by a medium-full body with elegant tannins, making this wine extremely food friendly. A pork tenderloin or rack of lamb are both great pairing options.

        <title>2023 Albarino</title>
        <description>&quot;The perfect match for oysters!&quot;
The fruit for this Morgan release is sourced from the Mission Ranch vineyard in the Arroyo Seco appellation. Located on the west side of the Salinas Valley, Arroyo Seco (meaning &amp;lsquo;dry river&amp;rsquo;) is uniquely characterized by an ancient riverbed surrounded by alluvial benchlands. Well-drained, stone-laden soil and cool coastal influence from nearby Monterey Bay yield grapes with concentrated flavor and balanced acidity.Traditionally grown in Spain and Portugal, albarino has been gaining popularity in California as a refreshing, crisp, and fragrant &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; varietal.The 2023 Albarino displays a beautiful straw color with aromas of honeydew and Meyer lemon. On the palate, these elements are joined by flavors of melon, key lime, and fruit blossom. This is a medium-light bodied white that&amp;rsquo;s delicious as an aperitif or paired with your favorite shellfish.

        <title>2023 Double L Dry Riesling</title>
        <description>&quot;True confession: While making Aperol spritzes for party guests on a hot summer afternoon, I was secretly sipping this.&quot;
Conscientiously farmed since the original plantings in 1997, today Morgan&amp;rsquo;s Double L Estate Vineyard is the only certified organic vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands. Located at the northern end of the AVA, the vineyard&amp;rsquo;s north-south row orientation provides optimal wind and sun exposure.
Our riesling grapes were foot stomped and left to macerate overnight, then the juice was cold settled after gentle pressing. Bright fruit character was preserved by cold fermentation in stainless steel tanks. Fermentation was allowed to finish, achieving this dry style.
In the glass, the 2021 Double L Dry Riesling displays a graceful, appealing nose of chamomile, white peach, and apple blossom. Traditional riesling flavors of green apple and key lime work beautifully with the wine&amp;rsquo;s opulent aromatics. Bright acidity makes this bone-dry riesling a good pairing for oysters, summer salads, and soft, creamy cheeses.

        <title>2023 Double L Riesling</title>
        <description>&quot;A citrus and tropical fruit mix that will have you reaching for more.&quot; 
Conscientiously farmed since the original plantings in 1997, today the Double L is the only certified organic vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands. Located at the northern end of the AVA, the vineyard&amp;rsquo;s unique north-south row orientation provides optimal wind and sun exposure.Our riesling grapes were foot stomped and left to macerate over night, then the juice was cold settled after gentle pressing. Freshness and bright fruit character were preserved by cold fermentation, which was then arrested by chilling to achieve an off-dry style and low alcohol.
The 2023 Double L Riesling displays a graceful, appealing nose of stone fruit and Meyer lemon. Characteristic riesling flavors of nectarine and green apple work beautifully with the wine&amp;rsquo;s opulent aromatics. This wine&amp;rsquo;s style starts with subtle sweetness, yet finishes bright and dry (much like a traditional German &amp;ldquo;Kabinett&amp;rdquo;). It is a natural pairing for spicy Asian cuisine or Roquefort cheese.

        <title>2023 Highland Chardonnay</title>
        <description>&quot;Impeccably made and incredibly drinkable.&quot;
With each vintage of Highland Chardonnay, we showcase the unique attributes of the Santa Lucia Highlands AVA. The 2023 cuv&amp;eacute;e includes 50% fruit from our certified organic Double L estate, with the balance from outstanding neighbors, including McIntyre and Tondr&amp;eacute; vineyards.The grapes were hand picked and sorted in the vineyard. Whole cluster pressing preserved the fruit flavors with fresh acidity. Barrel fermentation occurred in 25% new French oak with native and cultured yeasts. Malolactic conversion ensured silky richness and a medium body.This focused, elegant chardonnay features aromas of lemon, pearberry, and baking spices, complemented by flavors of pineapple, lemon curd, and a hint of butterscotch on the palate. Incredibly food-friendly, the Highland Chardonnay is a perfect match for white fish, poultry, and light pasta dishes.

        <title>2023 Metallico Un-oaked Chardonnay</title>
        <description>&quot;My go-to Chard!&quot;
Metallico is chardonnay in its purest form, unadorned by oak. Select clones from top growers display intense tropical aromas and minerality.Upon arriving at the winery, the grapes were whole-cluster pressed. After pressing, the juice was cold tank fermented, retaining the essential bright fruit and mineral characters. The wine did not go through a secondary malolactic fermentation.Metallico&amp;rsquo;s aromatics are intense with honeydew, white flowers, and chamomile. The palate has ripe fruit flavors of peach, papaya, and pineapple. This wine encompasses a light-medium body with bright acidity and a long finish. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect accompaniment to shellfish and lighter summertime fare.

        <title>2023 Rosé Of Grenache</title>
        <description>&quot;The perfect summer sipper.&quot;
The fruit for this Morgan release is sourced from the Mission Ranch vineyard in the Arroyo Seco appellation. Located on the west side of the Salinas Valley, Arroyo Seco (meaning &amp;lsquo;dry river&amp;rsquo;) is uniquely characterized by an ancient riverbed surrounded by alluvial benchlands. Well-drained, stone-laden soil and cool coastal influence from nearby Monterey Bay yield grapes with concentrated flavor and balanced acidity.Our Ros&amp;eacute; of Grenache is produced using fruit dedicated solely to ros&amp;eacute; production, picked at lower sugar and higher acids. The grapes were destemmed and left to macerate for one hour, then pressed. Its clean fermentation yielded a wine with bright fruit flavors and refreshing acidity, making it light and approachable.Ros&amp;eacute; is one of our favorite summer releases. Lively aromas of orange blossom, nectarine, strawberry, and fuji apple are followed by flavors of grapefruit and peach. Dry and light bodied, this wine is incredibly versatile &amp;ndash; try it chilled for a patio lunch with caprese salad and salmon tartare.

        <title>2023 Sauvignon Blanc</title>
        <description>&quot;A brilliantly bright and fresh bottling.&quot;
This bottling is sourced from various vineyards in Monterey County&amp;rsquo;s Arroyo Seco Appellation. Drawing from sites on the cool, northern end of the AVA provides bright acidity and grassy characters, which are complemented by citrus and tropical flavors from the warmer vineyards to the south.The 2023 season began with a classically cold and legendarily wet winter and spring (40% above average rainfall in Monterey County) which delayed bud break, bloom, and fruit set. Healthy crop loads and canopies developed through the summer, necessitating extra hedging to manage shade amid relatively high mildew pressure. Harvest began on September 21st, and concluded on November 8th after nearly two months of beautiful weather. Perhaps the coldest and wettest season since 2011, the resulting wines are fresh and aromatic, with bright acidity, moderate alcohol, and elegant texture.The 2023 Sauvignon Blanc features aromas of bell pepper, lime blossom, tarragon, and spice. Flavors of citrus pith, peach, and grapefruit are lively and refreshing. The small touch of oak accents the bright acidity by adding elegant texture. An incredibly food-versatile wine, it&amp;rsquo;s a natural match for shellfish, seafood, and lighter summer fare.
