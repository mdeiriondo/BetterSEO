        <title>2015 Cabernet Sauvignon Los Carneros</title>
        <description>Wine Profile
    Tasting Notes
    A dark ruby colored, juicy wine with a rich and generous palate, our Los Carneros
    Cabernet Sauvignon has black plum and blackberry fruit; tobacco and unsweetened
    mocha aromas and flavors that lead seamlessly into a smoky, fruity finish.

    79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc, 8% Merlot

    Vineyard Notes
    While Los Carneros is known for its cooling fog and bay breezes,
    this wine reveals an ideally situated vineyard for cabernet sauvignon.
    This wine is sourced from a vineyard in the warmer, northern part of Napa
    Valley's Los Carneros appellation. The southwest-facing slopes of this site
    capture sunlight and warmth for the development of ripe, rich flavors in our cabernet sauvignon.

    The region's combination of warm days and cool nights endured through
    the growing season creating the perfect recipe for long, flavor-building
    hang time and optimal sugar to acid balance. We harvested our select Los
    Carneros cabernet sauvignon grapes for this wine between October 27th and October 28th.

    Winemaker Notes
    Our vineyard team hand-harvested the fruit in the cool early morning
    hours to retain vibrancy and bright acidity. After gentle de-stemming,
    the wine fermented in oak tanks. The 38-day extended skin contact extracted
    maximum flavors and silky tannins. After a gentle basket pressing, the wine
    was carefully transferred to French oak barrels (32% new) for malolactic
    fermentation. Twenty-two months of barrel-aging provided additional dimension
    to this elegant cabernet sauvignon, and the wine was bottled in December of 2016.</description>

        <title>2017 Cabernet Sauvignon Stags Leap District</title>
        <description>Wine Profile:
    Tasting Notes:
    Our 2012 Stags Leap District cabernet sauvignon is a pure expression of Napa Valley's premier
    cabernet sauvignon known to meld power with elegant richness. The flavors are exotic: red
    fruits, sweet plum, violet floral, sweet vanilla, and a defining note of black pepper.

    100% Cabernet Sauvignon

    Vineyard Notes:
    A special breeze passes through the hills of the renowned Stags Leap District making it
    slightly cooler at night than other areas in the region. This subtle climate variation
    and the appellation's unique soils of old river sediments and heavy loamy clay, help
    provide for the low vigor vines and robust yet elegantly balanced wines of this District's
    famed three square miles.

    Winemaker Notes:
    Our Stags Leap cabernet sauvignon was hand-harvested and carefully sorted in our gravity-flow
    cellar. The clusters were destemmed directly into traditional French oak tanks for cold soak,
    fermentation and extended maceration– a total of 36 days of wine to skin contact – maximizing
    the extraction of varietal character and complexity while keeping the tannins fleshy and
    supple. The new wine was drained and gently pressed into 94% new French-oak barrels for
    full malolactic fermentation and the seamless integration of fruit and oak. The final blend
    was assembled through repeated
    tasting trials over the twenty-two months of barrel aging. The wine was bottled in December
    of 2017.</description>

        <title>Peach Bellini Sparkling Custom Labeled</title>
        <description>Wine Profile: Tasting Notes: This Chardonnay opens with aromas reminiscent of fresh baked apple pie and poached pears. A slightly toasted hazelnut oak influence blends gracefully and the wine finishes with great length and freshness. 100% Chardonnay Vineyard Notes: After two unusually cool, wet vintages, the 2017 growing season was a delightful return to the weather pattern that has made Napa Valley famous - virtually stress free conditions for the vines and the growers. The mild conditions and lack of rainfall during the season allowed the generous crop to mature slowly and evenly. This harvest was almost 3 weeks earlier than 2016 and grapes for this Chardonnay were picked between September 19 and September 27. Winemaker Notes: The fruit was cluster-pressed and all of the juice was fermented in French oak barrels (8 % new). The wine remained in barrel for fourteen months allowing the oak influence to completely integrate. Malolactic fermentation offered additional creaminess and character. The wine was bottled January 2018.</description>
